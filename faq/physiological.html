<H1><CENTER>9 &nbsp; Physiological Effects of DXM</CENTER></H1>

<P><BR>
This section explains some of what is currently known about DXM and
its physiological effects. As the recreational use of DXM is not well
studied, most of that information is speculation, some of it entirely
mine. To be more precise, a great deal of it is "scientific
wild-assed guessing" (SWAGging) and should only be taken as
interesting and unproven hypotheses.</P>

<P>A lot of this chapter is very technical. In the next chapter
(<A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10">Section 10</A>), you will find an
introduction to neuropharmacology, and the glossary (<A HREF="glossary.html#toc.16">Section
16</A>) contains definitions and explanations for the technical
terms.</P>

<H2><CENTER>9.1 &nbsp; How Does DXM Inhibit the Cough
Reflex?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
This is a complex problem. The cough reflex generally involves a
series of signals originating from the throat, lungs, and nasal
passages, and ending up in the muscles. At any point in this pathway,
signals can be blocked. Sigma receptors are evidently involved in
this pathway (<A HREF="refs.html#r42">42</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r49">49</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r55">55</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r56">56</A>).
This may be a direct involvement - sigma activation may directly
inhibit the cough reflex signals - or it may be an indirect one. The
cough suppressant effect of opiates (such as codeine) is not related
to the same effect of non-opiate morphinans like DXM (<A HREF="refs.html#r49">49</A>);
instead, it seems to be governed by traditional opiate receptors (mu,
kappa, or delta).</P>

<P>There is some evidence that 5HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors (a
serotonin receptor type) are involved somewhere in this pathway, and
that cough suppressants may increase 5HT<SUB>1A</SUB> activity
(<A HREF="refs.html#r57">57</A>), possibly via NMDA antagonism
(<A HREF="refs.html#r90">90</A>). This could explain some of DXM's
mood-altering activity. 5HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors are involved in
anxiety states and in resilience to aversive events. Buspirone, a
5HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptor partial agonist, is an anti-anxiety drug
less potent (but considerably safer) than the benzodiazepines such as
diazepam (Valium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.1 &nbsp; General Information</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM binds to at least four sites in the brain (<A HREF="refs.html#r58">58</A>),
which can be arbitrarily labeled DM<SUB>1</SUB>, DM<SUB>2</SUB>,
DM<SUB>3</SUB>, and DM<SUB>4</SUB>; there is probably also a fifth
binding site (DM<SUB>5</SUB>). Some of these sites are sensitive to
pentazocine, a known sigma ligand; some are sensitive to haloperidol,
another sigma ligand. On the following table, information from
several sources has been gathered and combined. The binding affinity
of DXM, DTG, and 3-PPP are listed (<A HREF="refs.html#r58">58</A>),
along with (+)-pentazocine sensitivity (<A HREF="refs.html#r60">60</A>),
and haloperidol displacement ability (<A HREF="refs.html#r58">58</A>)
(binding values in nM unless otherwise specified). "Low" means
micromolar binding affinity.</P>

</TABLE>
</P>

<P>What this table demonstrates is that DXM binds to four separate
places, two with high affinity. The first receptor is accepted to be
the sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptor based on the binding to pentazocine
and haloperidol, and the potency of (+)-3-PPP. The second receptor is
almost certainly the PCP<SUB>2</SUB> receptor, given the
insensitivity to pentazocine, and the very high affinity for DXM. The
third site is <I>probably</I> sigma<SUB>2</SUB> (based on the potency
of DTG) but it is possible that "DM<SUB>1</SUB>" in this table
represents both sigma<SUB>1</SUB> and sigma<SUB>2</SUB> and that the
third site is something else. The fourth site is probably the NMDA
receptor's open channel site, although it might be the ion channel
binding site (<A HREF="refs.html#r59">59</A>).</P>

<P>I don't have information on the binding of DXO (dextrorphan),
unfortunately. It would probably show strongest binding at DM4 (NMDA
open channel site), followed by DM<SUB>1</SUB> (sigma<SUB>1</SUB>),
and then by DM<SUB>3</SUB> (sigma<SUB>2</SUB>) and/or DM<SUB>2</SUB>
(PCP<SUB>2</SUB>), or both. I'm looking for this information
currently.</P>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.2 &nbsp; Contribution of the PCP<SUB>2</SUB> Binding
Site</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The PCP<SUB>2</SUB> binding site is probably the dopamine reuptake
complex, so blocking it would prevent the uptake of dopamine in much
the same way that the antidepressant bupropion
(Wellbutrin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) or cocaine does
(<A HREF="refs.html#r73">73</A>). Of course, DXM is considerably
weaker than cocaine (and stronger than bupropion, incidentally) at
this site. This probably accounts for the euphoric effects of a low
recreational dose, and almost certainly explains the stimulant
effects of a low dose. Interestingly, the stimulant effect seems
qualitatively different from amphetamines to most people (I have no
comparison information on cocaine). One user compared DXM and
bupropion favorably in stimulant effect. Incidentally, it seems that
DXM may bind noncompetitively at the dopamine reuptake site whereas
bupropion binds competitively.</P>

<P>The music euphoria and motion euphoria are probably partly due to
PCP<SUB>2</SUB> activity, and partly due to other activity. As NMDA
blockade and sigma activity can both lead to dopaminergic activity
(see below), reuptake inhibition would potentiate these effects.</P>

<P>Interestingly, DXM seems to be much more potent at this site than
other sigma/NMDA ligands (such as PCP or ketamine) in comparison to
activity at other sites. Also interestingly, at least one tricyclic
antidepressant has been found to be active at related receptors
(sigma, PCP) (<A HREF="refs.html#r71">71</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r74">74</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r75">75</A>);
it is possible that the PCP<SUB>2</SUB> site may be a target of some
antidepressants.</P>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.3 &nbsp; Contribution of the Sigma Binding
Sites</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
As the sigma<SUB>2</SUB> site is a fairly recent discovery, it is not
known what sigma-related effects and behaviors are attributable to
which receptor (sigma<SUB>1</SUB> or sigma<SUB>2</SUB>). There is
very little data on the subjective effects of sigma ligands, in part
because only recently have selective ligands become available, and in
part because most researchers aren't very willing to dose themselves
to find out. DXM binds to the sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptor and is
generally considered to be an agonist at this receptor. DXM is
probably also an agonist (as opposed to an antagonist) at
sigma<SUB>2</SUB>, though it is much weaker there.</P>

<P>The disruption of sensory processing may be due in part to sigma
activation (and partly due to NMDA blockade) (<A HREF="refs.html#r63">63-65</A>).
Sigma receptors may be specifically involved in the auditory effects
of DXM (<A HREF="refs.html#r65">65</A>), and these effects may relate
to a disruption of sensory input persistence.</P>

<P>The psychotomimetic (literally "psychosis-like") effects of DXM
may be a result of sigma activity since sigma receptors seem to have
some involvement in schizophrenia (<A HREF="refs.html#r46">46-49</A>).
People who have used both DXM and ketamine have remarked that DXM is
much more likely to induce delusional and hyper-abstract thought
patterns. Sigma receptors may temporarily modulate cholinergic
receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r97">97</A>), so sigma activity may
produce temporary effects somewhat like the delusional
anticholinergics.</P>

<P>The effects on motor skills may be a result specifically of
sigma<SUB>2</SUB> receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r69">69</A>). Expect
to see more data on this subject as sigma<SUB>2</SUB> receptors are
investigated more fully. There may also be a contribution from NMDA
receptors, of course.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.9.2.4"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.4 &nbsp; Contribution of the NMDA
Receptor</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Dextrorphan (DXO) is much more potent than DXM at the NMDA
receptor, which accounts for the slow onset of most of DXM's effects
even when it is injected. The NMDA receptor is the central site of
dissociative action, and is probably the main contributor to most of
DXM's effects. Dissociatives, including DXM, act on the NMDA receptor
by binding to its channel once it opens up, essentially plugging it
up.</P>

<P>Most of the "stoning" or intoxicating effects of DXM are due to
NMDA receptor blockade. Alcohol's intoxicating effect seems to be
mediated in part by NMDA receptor blockade (alcohol's depressant
effect is due to GABA activity; DXM has no activity at GABA
receptors) (<A HREF="refs.html#r28">28</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r61">61</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r62">62</A>).
The dissociative anesthesia of high DXM doses is also likely due to
NMDA receptor blockade (<A HREF="refs.html#r63">63</A>).</P>

<P>As stated before, sensory processing disruption, especially at
higher doses, is probably due in part to NMDA receptors and partly to
sigma (<A HREF="refs.html#r63">63-65</A>). NMDA blockade is probably
responsible for most if not all of the flanging effects of DXM,
especially visual flanging. This is likely an indirect effect, i.e.,
the blockade of NMDA receptors induces changes in the way the brain
processes information, leading to flanging.</P>

<P>The effects on memory are almost certainly due to NMDA blockade.
NMDA receptors are intimately involved in long-term potentiation
(<A HREF="refs.html#r64">64</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r66">66-68</A>),
the primary mechanism behind intermediate-term memory (ITM) and
long-term memory (LTM). By blocking NMDA receptors, long-term
potentiation, and thus intermediate- and long-term memory encoding,
are disrupted.</P>

<P>NMDA blockade indirectly (<A HREF="refs.html#r244">244</A>)
increases dopamine activity in the striatum, nucleus accumbens,
olfactory tubercule, and prefrontal cortex (<A HREF="refs.html#r204">204</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r226">226</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r326">326</A>).
Increased activity at dopamine D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors is responsible
for the increased locomotor activity seen in rats on dissociatives
(<A HREF="refs.html#r178">178</A>), and may be responsible for many
of the effects DXM has on motion. Chronic use of DXM may result in
upregulation of dopamine D<SUB>2</SUB> receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r205">205</A>).</P>

<P>DXM's ability to suppress respiration at toxic levels is most
likely due to NMDA receptor blockade or (in my opinion) ion channel
blockade. Some of the effects from very high dosage levels may be due
to overall disruption of neural networks. There is some preliminary
evidence that both the "spontaneous memory" effect and the sensations
similar to near-death experiences may occur as limbic areas (the
hippocampus and hippocampal formation and surrounding areas) are
disrupted by NMDA blockade. Most drugs target specific, small
clusters of neurons (or their receptors, which can be scattered
about). Both excitatory amino acid secreting neurons and NMDA
receptors tend to be more evenly distributed, although they too are
concentrated in certain areas of the brain to a lesser extent.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.9.2.5"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.5 &nbsp; Temporal Lobe Involvement</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Probably the greatest degree of DXM's effects come from consequences
of the aforementioned receptor binding on the temporal lobe limbic
areas. The blockade of NMDA receptors by DXM has specific
consequences in these areas. The normal functioning of the
hippocampus and amygdala are disrupted since NMDA blockade prevents
long-term potentiation. The posterior cingulate and retrosplenial
cortex paradoxically become more active. There may be spontaneous
"noise" effects in the entire limbic system amplified by feedback.
One paper suggested that dissociatives may induce "microseizures" or
limited areas of high activity in the limbic system (<A HREF="refs.html#r176">176</A>).</P>

<P>There is also the suggestion of a "top-down" inhibition of the
senses, i.e., inhibitory signals from the limbic areas and
surrounding cortical areas are sent "down" to sensory networks,
lowering the strength of sensory data. This "top-down" inhibition of
the senses may be the mechanism behind dissociative anaesthesia;
sensory information is still processed by the brain, but never makes
it to the conscious mind and is never encoded in intermediate-term
declarative memory (in the hippocampus).</P>

<P>Finally, dissociatives seem to alter the flow of signals through
the limbic areas, possibly increasing the degree of internal feedback
within these areas (or between these areas and the neocortex) and
diminshing the amount of sensory data that comes in. Gating of
signals coupled to the theta rhythm through the posterior cingulate
(<A HREF="refs.html#r311">311</A>) may be altered.</P>

<P>Putting this all together into some sort of cohesive theory may be
too soon but I'm going to do it anyway. My belief (which will
probably change as new research becomes available) is that the
diminished sensory data (from top-down inhibition), and the decreased
encoding of intermediate-term memory, combined with the enhancement
of activity in the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, all
lead to an increasingly closed feedback loop. Within this loop,
random noise, individual differences in temporal lobe "wiring", the
contents of intermediate memory, and the influence of electromagnetic
fields (<A HREF="refs.html#r332">332</A>) all combine to give rise to
profoundly abnormal neural patterns.</P>

<P>An interesting aside to this is that the sense of smell is
sometimes reported to be enhanced on DXM. This hasn't been formally
studied, and may be all in one's mind, but since olfactory data is
treated somewhat differently by the brain than the other senses, it
may be spared from the descending inhibitory signals that attenuate
other sensory data. If so, then the feedback loop could actually
serve to increase the strength of olfactory data, by repeatedly
adding the same, small signals together.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.9.2.6"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.6 &nbsp; Contributions of Indirect
Activity</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Many of DXM's effects are undoubtedly due to indirect activity at
other neurotransmitter systems. For example, it may indirectly
increase 5HT activity, especially at the 5HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptor.
This could explain some of its mood-altering properties. Another
example is dopaminergic activity; DXM has a fairly strong ability to
increase dopamine activity (both from activating sigma receptors, and
from preventing dopamine reuptake at PCP<SUB>2</SUB> sites)
(<A HREF="refs.html#r72">72</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r76">76</A>). NMDA
receptor blockade also has been shown to increase dopaminergic
activity, as well as activity of other neurotransmitter systems
(<A HREF="refs.html#r100">100</A>).</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.9.2.7"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.7 &nbsp; Flanging</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
One of DXM's most prominent effects if the flanging of sensory input.
This happens to some extent with many drugs, and I have a hypothesis
on this. Note in particular the relation of flanging to "stoning" and
"buzzing" - in some ways, flanging is a more profound degree of
stoning. Some people have noticed a flanging or strobing effect after
smoking a great deal of cannabis, and nitrous oxide users are also
familiar with flanging of sounds. Even alcohol can produce it.</P>

<P>What it seems many of these drugs have in common is the ability to
inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation. Some have suggested that
there are more than one set of signals that pass through the same
limbic areas, with those in phase with the theta frequency and those
out of phase being gated differently. Perhaps one set of signals is
more strongly involved with memory, and the other set more strongly
involved with sensory data. Or, perhaps all drugs which inhibit
hippocampal LTP all activate the posterior cingulate cortex. In
either case, signals at one phase of the theta rhythm could be
disrupted, leading to a pulsing of perception in step with theta
rhythm.</P>

<P>A different theory is that networks in the brain will re-process
the same data repeatedly until a stable configuration is formed, and
that DXM (and other drugs) slow down this process. With some networks
slowed down and others operating at normal speeds, the characteristic
frequencies of the two sets of signals would differ, leading to a
"beat frequency" in much the same way that two very similar sounds
can lead to a beat frequency (for a quick demonstration of this,
listen to someone tuning a guitar by ear).</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.9.2.8"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.8 &nbsp; Hyper-Abstraction</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Another interesting effect of DXM is its ability to induce peculiar
cognitive disturbances, which I lump together under the term of
"hyper-abstraction". Two examples:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>A <I>meme </I>is a "particle" or "virus" of thought - an idea
   which is in some ways self-contained, and which spreads like a
   virus. For example, the idea of civil liberties is a meme, which
   at some point sprang into existence, spread rapidly, and has now
   become an integral part of our consciousness. One user during a
   DXM trip suddenly became aware of (or thought up) "The
   self-invoking, self-creating meme", which was the concept of a
   meme whose identification creates and invokes it. It seemed that
   this meme was timeless in the sense that it must have always
   existed, or it could not have come to mind, since it is not easily
   deducible from anything other than itself (of course, the brain
   doesn't work on the rules of logic, but ... you get the
   point)</LI>
   
   <LI>Another user wrote of thinking about convergent infinite sums
   (e.g., 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + etc., which sums up to 1). Although one
   can add these terms up forever, it's easier to abstract the
   process and get the answer that way. This user imagined an
   infinite series of abstractions, and then imagined abstracting
   that infinite series to get a new level or plane of
   abstraction.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Many DXM thought patterns involve what some have called "Strange
Loops" in logic (<A HREF="refs.html#r137">137</A>). Like the
self-contradicting statement "this statement is false", some of them
cannot be embodied in logical form; others can be, but cannot be
derived without presenting them as hypothesis. Thinking at this
degree of abstraction is very difficult (unless you are fortunate
enough to be Kurt G&ouml;del).</P>

<P>Several people who have written first-person accounts of psychosis
and schizophrenia have mentioned increasingly abstract thought
patterns (<I>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</I> springs to
mind). This may of course be complete bunk, and it may be that the
increasingly "abstract" thoughts are just increasingly loony (and
thus difficult to relate to concrete ideas). On the other hand, it
may be that something about schizophrenia and psychotic states is
related to a blurring between levels of abstraction. Once blurred
sufficiently, a thought which cannot be represented at a concrete
degree of abstraction could be representable in the mind.</P>

<P>Thus, DXM may induce a sort of temporary blurring of these levels
of abstraction. Whether this is due to NMDA or sigma activity, I
don't know, although I suspect the latter, since other NMDA
antagonists don't tend to induce such changes in thought
patterns.</P>

<H3><CENTER>9.2.9 &nbsp; Delusions and Memory Problems</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
As stated above, sigma activity may modulate cholinergic receptors in
the brain (<A HREF="refs.html#r97">97</A>), leading to a temporary
decrease in cholinergic function similar to (but considerably safer
than) that caused by anticholinergics like atropine, scopolamine,
cyclizine (Marezine), etc. It is known that cholinergic activity is
important in memory, and many nootropics ("Smart Drugs") enhance
cholinergic function. Sigma activity may very well cause temporarily
lowered effectiveness in some cholinergic receptors, thus distorting
memory and thought processes. Some people have in fact said that DXM
makes them feel temporarily stupid ("Dumb Drugs", anyone?) although
this by no means happens to everyone.</P>

<P>Many of the biogenic amine systems seem to have a modulatory role,
and some researchers think these modulating systems operate much like
"control knobs". For example, one theory on LSD is that it upsets the
"gain control" on sensory recognition networks (possibly by
descending inhibition, although through different pathways than those
postulated for dissociatives). As a consequence, the random noise
input (necessary for any pattern matching network) becomes much
stronger than the sensory input. Sensory recognition becomes
increasingly less and less precise - ergo, hallucinations.</P>

<P>LSD's effects are almost certainly more complex than this, but
there may be some truth to the "control knob" idea of the biogenic
amine systems. If so, then the cholinergic systems may be the
"control knobs" for cognitive networks in much the same way that
5HT<SUB>2A</SUB>/5HT<SUB>2C</SUB> systems are for sensory recognition
networks. Delusions may simply be the cognitive equivalent of
hallucinations. Or to put it another way, the difference between
thinking you look like a flower and thinking you <I>are</I> a flower
may be a question of which network is disrupted.</P>

<P>Memory problems derive to some extent from NMDA blockade, although
some users of ketamine have remarked that DXM can have a stronger
effect on memory than ketamine. It is possible that, in addition to
inducing delusional thoughts, a decrease in cholinergic function
could be responsible for some of the memory problems. This is
certainly consistent with the effects of the delusional
anticholinergics.</P>

<P>Incidentally, the anticholinergics also affect acetylcholine
receptors that govern the functioning of the heart and respiration
(these receptors do not seem to be modulated by sigma activity).
Recreational use of anticholinergics can be extremely dangerous,
leading to collapse of respiration or heart failure.</P>

Receptors</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="figure2.gif" WIDTH=297 HEIGHT=213 ALIGN=bottom vspace=4 hspace=4>
</P>

<P>This graph illustrates a potential effect of multiple receptors.
Note that it is a qualitative drawing, not a quantitative one; the
actual degree of saturation on different receptors for a given
strength of DXM is still mostly unknown. The lines represent
saturation levels at the PCP<SUB>2</SUB>, sigma<SUB>1</SUB>, and NMDA
open channel sites, with full saturation at a given receptor
indicated by the "flattening out" of the curve. The X axis is the
concentration of DXM; the Y axis is the percent saturation of
receptors.</P>

<P>Incidentally, if you are familiar with this sort of thing, you may
be more comfortable with a Lineweaver-Burk plot, but for those
unfamiliar with them they can be confusing.</P>

<P>Due to its increasing affinity for PCP<SUB>2</SUB>,
sigma<SUB>1</SUB>, and NMDA receptors respectively (sigma<SUB>2</SUB>
is not represented), a low dose will tend to have proportionally more
effect on PCP<SUB>2</SUB> receptors, whereas as the dosage increases,
these receptors will saturate. Taking more DXM won't change
PCP<SUB>2</SUB> levels much, but will still have a fair effect on
other receptors.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the more subtle effects on the PCP<SUB>2</SUB>
receptors may be all but obliterated by the effects on
sigma<SUB>1</SUB> and NMDA receptors (the differing vertical maxima
of the three curves represent this effect). This is entirely
reasonable, since sigma<SUB>1</SUB> and NMDA activity seem to both
produce fairly profound behavioral effects, the latter more so than
the former.</P>

<P>Thus, the first plateau may correspond to predominantly
PCP<SUB>2</SUB> activity with some sigma activity and a little NMDA
blocking effect; the second plateau to sigma and some NMDA effects;
and the third to profound NMDA blockade.</P>

<P>This is, of course, a simplification, and it certainly doesn't
take into account individual variations in receptors. Some people
probably have genetic variants of receptors for which DXM has a
stronger (or weaker) affinity. A person with PCP<SUB>2</SUB>
receptors strongly bound by DXM may enjoy its stimulant effects a
great deal more than someone whose PCP<SUB>2</SUB> receptors are only
weakly affected.</P>

<P>Additionally, both ion channels and sigma<SUB>2</SUB> receptors
are omitted from this graph. They undoubtedly contribute, and some
people have asserted that there are plateaus in between the first
three. Some of these may be so subtle as to be unnoticeable by most
users.</P>

<H3><CENTER>9.3.2 &nbsp; The Fourth Plateau: Sensory
Shutdown</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<IMG SRC="figure3.gif" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=369 ALIGN=bottom vspace=4 hspace=4></P>

<P>What about the fourth plateau? Well, once again, here's another
little drawing that will hopefully clear up everything (yeah, right).
This drawing represents a neural network; the dots are the neurons
and the lines are their connections. Like most of the brain, this
network is highly interconnected. The percentage numbers show the
number of functional links remaining.</P>

<P>As enough NMDA receptors are blocked, one neuron may lose enough
input from another that the connection is effectively severed.
Initially this isn't such a problem, since both neurons and
connections are dense enough so that others can take over the job
(although the end result will probably be a slower and less accurate
network). At some point, enough connectivity is lost that the network
no longer functions.</P>

<P>Compare this to the dissociation of the fourth plateau. At some
level, some part of the brain (possibly the hippocampus) loses enough
functionality that it can no longer operate as a cohesive unit.
Sensory processing halts, and raw sensory input cannot be converted
to an appropriately parsed output. The consciousness is then left
without any real sensory input; instead, the chaotic, unstable
patterns are provided. Ergo, dissociative anesthesia.</P>

<P>On the other hand, it may be that the threshold of the Fourth
Plateau is reached when sensory information becomes inhibited enough
for the neural signals in the limbic areas to feed back without
substantially being "grounded" in sensory input. This feedback loop
continues to perturb the neural signal patterns until they are
totally disconnected from any state one is likely to encounter from
either sensory input or memory.</P>

<H2><CENTER>9.4 &nbsp; Why is This So Complicated?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
DXM itself is a very complex drug; most drugs only bind to one or two
receptors (or at least one class of receptors). Its recreational
abuse potential, although known for years, has not been well studied,
and it can affect different people very differently. The receptors
and binding sites it affects - sigma, NMDA, and PCP<SUB>2</SUB> - are
all new discoveries. All this adds up to a complicated and poorly
understood drug.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the brain itself is a complicated system, and we're
still mostly ignorant of its function. The basics of
neurotransmission seem to be understood, but many questions remain.
Nobody knows why there are so many different neurotransmitters, nor
why there are so many receptor subtypes. The second messenger systems
of most receptors are not well understood either. A lot of what
happens inside neurons occurs via changes in genetic expression, and
that's yet another topic about which little is known.</P>

<P>To repeat a commonly quoted (and true) sentiment, if our brains
were simple enough for us to easily understand, we would be so simple
that we couldn't understand them. I do believe that eventually we
will have a good idea of how the brain works, but it may not be in my
lifetime. Until then we're all just making guesses in the dark.</P>

<H2><CENTER>9.5 &nbsp; Pharmacokinetics: How DXM is
Metabolized</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
DXM, as the hydrobromide salt, is absorbed quickly from the GI tract;
within 30 minutes, all of it may have entered the bloodstream
(<A HREF="refs.html#r2">2</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r3">3</A>). The
polistirex compound is intended for continuous absorption, and may
take 6 to 8 hours to fully enter the bloodstream. <IMG SRC="figure4.gif" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=280 ALIGN=left vspace=4 hspace=4></P>

<P>DXM is metabolized via two pathways, both of which lead to the
same thing, 3-hydroxymorphinan (3HM). The first pathway goes from DXM
to DXO (dextrorphan) and then to 3HM; the second goes from DXO to
3-methoxymorphinan (3MM) and then to 3HM. By far most of the DXM (up
to 90%) gets metabolized via DXO in normal individuals.</P>

<P>DXM is converted to DXO by a liver enzyme called cytochrome
P450-2D6 (debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase). About 7% of Caucasians and
0.5% of Asians have a highly inefficient (70 times slower) version of
this enzyme, and cannot metabolize DXM to DXO effectively (<A HREF="refs.html#r10">10</A>).
About 0.5 to 2% of the population have multiple copies of the P450
gene, leading to extremely fast metabolism of DXM into DXO (<A HREF="refs.html#r155">155</A>).
After being converted to DXO, the enzymes P450-3A4 and P450-3A5
convert DXO to 3-hydroxymorphinan (<A HREF="refs.html#r77">77</A>).</P>

<P>The other pathway goes to 3-methoxymorphinan first (via P450-3A4
and P450-3A5), and then to 3-hydroxymorphinan. Most people do not
metabolize much DXM this way, although people who lack the normal
P450-2D6 will convert a substantial amount to 3MM. As 3MM is probably
not psychoactive, this means that the 5-10% who lack the normal 2D6
enzyme will experience less effect from DXM (or more specifically,
won't experience the effects of DXO).</P>

<P>P450-2D6 functions by removing the methoxy group and replacing it
with a hydroxyl (OH) (or more accurately, pruning the methyl off the
oxygen); this step is known as O-demethylation. P450-3A4 and 3A5
replace the methyl group with a hydrogen (H); this is the
N-demethylation step. Refer to the diagram of the DXM molecule in
<A HREF="general_info.html#toc.4.2">Section 4.2</A> for the location
of the methyl and methoxy groups.</P>

<H3><CENTER>9.5.1 &nbsp; Factors Affecting Metabolism of
DXM</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
As stated above, some people lack the normal P450-2D6 enzyme. In the
rest of the population, this enzyme can be inhibited by several
factors. Many drugs inhibit P450-2D6, notably including fluoxetine
(Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>). A partial list of
P450-2D6 inhibiting drugs is given in <A HREF="appendices.html#toc.15.1">Section
15.1</A>.</P>

<P>DXM itself naturally will compete with other drugs for P450-2D6,
and importantly, so will 3-methoxymorphinan (3MM) (<A HREF="refs.html#r17">17</A>).
In fact, 3MM may have more affinity for the P450-2D6 enzyme than DXM
itself does. This may account for the fact that a second "booster"
dose of DXM generally produces different effects than the first dose;
the competition for P450-2D6 will reduce the amount of DXM converted
to DXO in the second dose.</P>

<P>The following graphs come from computer simulations of DXM
metabolism: <IMG SRC="figure5.gif" WIDTH=615 HEIGHT=246 ALIGN=left vspace=4 hspace=4><BR clear=ALL>
<IMG SRC="http://www.frognet.net/dxm/images/figure6.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=left vspace=4 hspace=4><BR clear=ALL>
</P>

<P>The first pair represent the metabolism of DXM in a normal
individual (on the left) and an individual without the normal
P450-2D6 enzyme (on the right). Note the rapid and almost complete
conversion of DXM to DXO in the normal individual, as opposed to the
less efficient and slower conversion in the P450-2D6 lacking
individual.</P>

<P>The next pair demonstrate the probable results of taking
additional doses (dose boosting). Both graphs correspond to
individuals with the normal P450-2D6 variant. Note how the second
dose of DXM is not converted to DXO as quickly (thus the shallower
slope). The right hand graph shows numerous doses, and the
"flattening out" of the metabolism curve for DXM is increasingly
evident with each dose.</P>

<P>Incidentally, that these are <I>qualitative</I> simulations, not
quantitative ones. I have tried to adhere to known KM and VMAX values
for the applicable reactions, but the simulation was just a discrete
process (to be honest, my differential equation skills are rusty
enough that if you stepped on them you'd need a tetanus shot). I did
compare my results with what little data I could find, and the
comparison seemed reasonable, but then again I could be completely
off base. The purpose of these graphs is to demonstrate the relative
effects of changes in enzyme activity (via genetic variance and
competitive inhibition by 3MM), and hopefully this is good enough for
that purpose.</P>

<P>I have no information on what happens to 3-hydroxymorphinan
itself. It may be excreted directly by the kidneys, or it may undergo
further metabolism.</P>
