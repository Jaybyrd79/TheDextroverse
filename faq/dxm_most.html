<H1><CENTER>7 &nbsp; Getting the Most Out of DXM</CENTER></H1>

<P><BR>
This section covers various activities, methods, etc., that,
according to current and former DXM users, enhance the DXM
experience. Some readers may wonder about the appopriateness of this
section, given that I do try to discourage DXM abuse. Let me respond
to any potential objections by saying that I believe that safe,
responsible use of DXM is possible and should be encouraged. I
believe that some people will do psychedelics whether one wants them
to or not, so it's better to give everyone the opportunity to have a
safe and rewarding experience.</P>

<P>Let me go even further out onto the thin ice here and state that I
believe that all psychedelics have a place in exploration of
spirituality and consciousness, when used by mature and responsible
individuals. Most Western cultures shun the psychedelic experience,
and I believe this is unfortunate. While I don't think psychedelics
will give you special abilities, they do allow you to tap into
abilities that you didn't know you had. The key is to remember that
they are only tools and should be used as a means to an end, not an
end in and of themselves.</P>

<P>Okay, I've babbled long enough. Here are some suggestions from DXM
users on rewarding activities to combine with DXM.</P>

<H2><CENTER>7.1 &nbsp; General Tips on Enjoying the DXM
Experience</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The best advice I can pass along to you about enjoying DXM is not to
overdo it. Overusing any psychedelic will transform the magickal into
the mundane. Don't try to repeat a given trip, or to hold on to
something that happened before; trip experiences, like lovers, are
always lacking when revisited.</P>

<P>Additionally, you must be emotionally and mentally prepared for
DXM. No drug can give you what you don't already have inside
yourself, and if you are lacking in worldly experience, your
psychedelic experiences may seem hollow and stereotypical. I know we
live in a culture of instant gratification, but the old saying does
hold true with psychedelics: good things come to those who wait.</P>

<P>Try to give some thought to why you are taking DXM. Perhaps it is
for self-exploration, as a group experience, to immerse yourself in a
natural (or unnatural) environment, or simply to gain a new
perspective on something. Whatever the reason, make sure you have
one; if you just want a "buzz", go to Amsterdam and smoke marijuana.
Psychedelics should be used with respect and reverence for what they
show us.</P>

<P>I know not everyone is going to follow this advice, and, well,
that's your choice. Perhaps for you, psychedelics can be used
casually or even daily. Not everyone is wired the same. Just be
careful, please. Insanity isn't nearly as fun as it is portrayed.</P>

<H2><CENTER>7.2 &nbsp; What are Some Fun or Interesting Things to Do
on DXM?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
This section lists some things that various people have done on DXM
that they have enjoyed. Note that not everyone will agree, and some
of these activities may be unpleasant to some. Activities that are
pleasant at one dosage may not be so at another.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.2.1 &nbsp; Listen to Music</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Probably the most common fun thing to do on DXM, especially at lower
doses, is listen to music. Even at higher doses, music can be quite
enjoyable, and will often induce fantastic closed-eye visions and
hallucinations. Many people have in fact reported they were unable to
hallucinate without music. Some use music to help create an imaginary
setting for their hallucinatory experiences. Why music enhances the
DXM experience so much, I don't know; other dissociatives don't seem
to go nearly as well with music.</P>

<P>As for what music is best, that's a matter of personal opinion.
Some prefer classical music, saying it brings a transcendent feeling
and visions of flight. Rave and techno music are also popular,
possibly because of the strong, regular beat. Ambient seems popular,
especially towards the end of DXM trips, where it has a soothing
effect. Really, though, a lot has to do with what you like.</P>

<H2><CENTER>7.3 &nbsp; Watch a Movie</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Many people enjoy watching movies on DXM, typically at first to upper
second plateau levels (beyond that it becomes difficult to process
visual information). It seems that some types of movies lend
themselves particularly well to DXM, and when viewed, the DXM user
finds himself or herself totally immersed in the movie environment,
up to the point of perceiving the smells and tastes of that
environment, and empathizing with the characters. DXM can transform a
movie from something you watch to something you experience
directly.</P>

<P>Movies which go well with DXM typically have simple plots but can
have very complex environments. Sometimes the best DXM movies have no
plot at all (e.g., <I>Koyaanisqatsi</I>, which is a series of
montages and images which form a coherent, simple, and in some ways
disturbingly beautiful theme). Movies that are highly archetypical in
nature (such as <I>Excalibur</I>, as well as many Westerns) also go
well with DXM. One person reported that old B-movie Sci-Fi thrillers,
horror flicks, and the like also go well with DXM and become much
more fun.</P>

<P>One final word of advice. Since DXM impairs the ability to form
long-term memories, expect to be horribly confused unless you've seen
the movie before. So if you want to watch a movie on DXM, it might be
a good idea to watch it sober a day or two before, and give your mind
time to become familiar with the plot.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.3.1 &nbsp; Make Music</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Recently someone pointed out to me that, like other psychedelics, DXM
lends itself well to making music. Now, keep in mind that the music
may not sound like much to anyone else; I suspect that psychedelic
music-making is a type of feedback loop by which unconscious thoughts
and impulses can be brought into the conscious mind. Whatever the
reason, it does seem to be enjoyable to many.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.3.2 &nbsp; Dance</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Many people enjoy dancing on DXM, usually at the first plateau and
somewhat less commonly on the second. Third and fourth plateau doses
of DXM are almost certainly not compatible with dancing (or most
other motor skills). Raves are the most common DXM dancing event,
although I see no reason why any other type of dance couldn't be
enjoyable as well.</P>

<P>Please note that, as with any dissociative anesthetic, DXM can
make you less aware of overexertion, leaving you with a generally
sore body the next day. Also, as with any stimulant, take care not to
overheat or become dehydrated.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.3.3 &nbsp; Swimming (First Plateau Only!)</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
A few users have reported that swimming on a first plateau DXM trip
is an ecstatic experience. Evidently, the regular, rhythmic motions
of lap swimming go well with DXM's rhythmic nature, and the feeling
of the water supporting the body provides a deep sense of calm. There
should be little danger with swimming on a first plateau DXM dose,
although higher doses could become quite dangerous. Overexertion is
always a possibility, but fortunately swimming's low-impact nature
may minimize some potential injuries. In any case, if you do decide
to try swimming on DXM, never swim alone.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.3.4 &nbsp; Group Tripping</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
One of the characteristics of the NMDA/sigma class of psychedelics is
the ability of people tripping together to synchronize their
experiences as they discuss them. This is not unique to DXM; ketamine
users have noted the same effect, and although I have no reports I'm
certain PCP would act similarly.</P>

<P>Group use of DXM was fairly common among some members of the
hardcore warehouse subculture in the 1980's in the USA. People would
decide on a "destination" or goal for their trips (which some called
"vacations"), and choose music, decorations, and other stimuli to
match the destination. Destinations ranged from the specific to the
mythological (e.g., Hell). Talking during the trip helped maintain
synchronization. Most of the time, the environment (sights, sounds,
smells, etc.) was carefully crafted to fit the destination.</P>

<P>If you are planning a group DXM trip, it might be a good idea to
make sure that everyone is experienced with DXM beforehand, so that
they know what to expect. Try to adjust dosage for everyone to place
everyone at roughly the same place in the same plateau (group
tripping seems most effective at the upper second plateau). If
desired, pick a destination beforehand, and adjust your setting to
match. Be wary of intense or potentially unpleasant destinations (the
"vacation to Hell" mentioned above was undertaken by very experienced
DXM users). Try to make sure everyone stays together; many people
have reported that having someone leave can ruin the experience. And
above all, make sure someone sober is available to watch over you and
make sure nothing goes wrong.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.3.5 &nbsp; Paranormal/Spiritual
Exploration</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Dissociatives seem to lend themselves to paranormal experiences, and
there are some very mundane, physiological explanations for this.
Whether you accept the validity of these experiences or not, they
tend to be interesting, to say the least. An entire chapter of the
FAQ is devoted to the connection between DXM and paranormal
experiences; see <A HREF="dxm_paranormal.html#toc.8">Section

<H3><CENTER>7.3.6 &nbsp; Observe People</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Many DXM users have told me that DXM allows them to detatch
themselves from the unconscious influences in conversation and social
interaction, and to perceive these consciously. One person remarked
that, while on DXM, sober people's actions and words ranged from
obviously deceptive to downright silly, and were enormously
interesting to observe. I suspect that, by altering the "automatic"
or unconscious perception of social cues, DXM may allow these cues to
enter conscious awareness.</P>

<H2><CENTER>7.4 &nbsp; What Tools Can Enhance the DXM
Experience?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Since DXM becomes increasingly hard on the body and brain as the
dosage increases, it is generally a good idea to make as much as you
can out of a given dose. Here I offer the suggestions of various DXM
users on tools to enhance the depth or intensity of the trip. These
are especially useful at obtaining upper plateau effects from lower
plateau dosages.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.4.1 &nbsp; Sensory Deprivation</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Many of the interesting effects from DXM occur due to an inhibition
of sensory input, and a subsequent feedback loop that separates the
conscious mind from the senses and body. Although one can obtain this
from a high enough dose of DXM, it is also possible to boost the
effects of a low dose using sensory deprivation, which generally
increases the frequency of paranormal and altered state experiences
(<A HREF="refs.html#r332">332</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r338">338</A>).</P>

<P>For the ultimate in sensory deprivation, nothing beats a
floatation tank. Popularized by John Lilly, floatation or sensory
deprivation tanks are essentially nothing more than big boxes filled
with water which has been saturated with about a half a ton (450kg)
of epsom salts. You lie down in the water (in which you float, thanks
to the epsom salts), close the cover, and relax, and find yourself
cut off from all sensory input.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, float tanks don't come cheap. The low-end models
typically start at $2000; the high-end models (which come with
temperature control, built in stereo sound and video screens, etc.)
are considerably more expensive ($4000 and up). If you have that kind
of money, call <I>Tools for Exploration</I>, a company dedicated to
exploration of consciousness; their phone number is 1-800-456-9887 (I
have no affiliation with them).</P>

<P>For those without that kind of money but with good carpentry
skills, you can of course build your own. Keep in mind that you can't
just throw together a box and expect it to hold the stress imposed by
the water (not to mention you). I'm not particularly good with
carpentry, so I'm not going to even make suggestions here. But I do
know it can be done, as I have spoken with someone who built his own
float tank for $300 (not including the cost of the epsom salts). One
warning, though: if you plan on putting in a water heating system,
make good and goddamned sure it runs off a low-voltage supply and is
protected by a ground-fault interrupt device. If this is meaningless
to you, leave it to a qualified electrician.</P>

<P>Okay, so you're neither rich nor a carpenter, but still want to
play with sensory deprivation. Here are a few suggestions.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Take a warm (not hot) bath in a dark room. You can experiment
   with various essential oils to provide an olfactory sensorium, or
   just use water. This is actually fairly effective from all
   accounts, but make sure there isn't so much water that you could
   pass out and drown. Keeping someone with you might be a good
   idea.</LI>
   
   <LI>Get yourself a pair of good quality earplugs. The foam kind
   you can buy at the drugstore are OK, but there are better ones
   available which will block out more sound. This will help with
   sensory deprivation.</LI>
   
   <LI>Find someplace nice and comfortable and lie down. After
   awhile, your brain will become used to the unchanging tactile
   input and you'll be able to ignore it.</LI>
   
   <LI>Instead of sensory deprivation, try a <I>ganzfeld</I> (see the
   next section).</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.7.4.2"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>7.4.2 &nbsp; Ganzfeld</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
There is one major problem to sensory deprivation, which is that even
in conditions of total darkness and silence, one will typically
continue to perceive sight (phosphenes) and sound (tinnitus, or
ringing in the ears). There are numerous causes for this, but it all
boils down to the fact that as you boost the gain on any sensory
detection system (natural or artificial), you end up with more and
more noise.</P>

<P>When scientists were studying psychic phenomena, they ran into
this problem, and rather than using drugs to enhance sensory cutoff,
they chose to take a different approach: the <I>ganzfeld</I>. A
ganzfeld, (literally, "total field") is a set of constant,
predictable sensory inputs. In a typical ganzfeld experiment, the
subject is placed in a comfortable chair in an isolated room, with
translucent filters placed over his or her eyes, and a dim, constant
light source (usually red). Sound may be absent, or white noise may
be used.</P>

<P>This sounds a lot more expensive than it usually is. In many
experiments (remember, this is often on the fringes of science, so
budgets aren't terribly high), the "translucent filters" are
ping-pong (table tennis) balls cut in two, and the white noise is
provided by an AM radio.</P>

<P>This is surprisingly easy to recreate in the comfort of your own
home. Buy a pack of (white) ping-pong balls, and cut one in half. Let
it sit open for a few days to let the ubiquitous "ping-pong ball
smell" dissipate. Tape over the sharp edges of the half ping-pong
balls with transparent tape over the edges so there are no sharp
edgesPlace a comfy chair in the center of a room, and place a few
dim, red bulbs in the lights. Get yourself an AM radio and tune it to
a nonexistent station to provide a white noise, and turn the volume
down to where it is comfortable. Sit down in the comfy chair, adjust
it to where you can totally relax, and place the two ping pong balls
over your closed eyes.</P>

<P>This does seem to work, although not as well as a sensory
deprivation tank. The going theory among most researchers with whom
I've spoken is that the sensory networks typically create internal
models of the external world and only report when things change. In
other words, you perceive not the external world, but the difference
between your internal world and the sensory input. As long as sensory
input stays exactly the same, the sensory networks don't really
generate much output, and the conscious mind is once again left alone
to do its own thing.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.4.3 &nbsp; Light and Sound (Brainwave)
Machines</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<I>Light and Sound Machines</I> are devices which use flashing light
and sounds to induce changes in brainwave activity. The simplest of
these, costing as little as $20, consists of a bunch of LEDs hooked
up to a timer chip with a potentiometer for you to adjust the
flashing frequency. The most complex of these (I've seen them list
for as much as $500) are full- fledged portable computers which can
independently control multicolored lights for each eye, as well as
stereo headphones. Some of them allow you to plug in your own music,
and will layer the brainwave beat frequency on top of it.</P>

<P>These are available from a number of sources, including the
aforementioned <I>Tools for Exploration</I> (call for their catalog),
"new age" stores, science stores, and of course on the Internet. To
some degree you get what you pay for, but keep in mind that not
everyone responds to these gadgets, and you may be better off not
forking over the big bucks until you're sure it will be worth it.
There's also a shareware program for PC's called "flasher" (see
<A HREF="#toc.7.4.5">Section 7.4.5</A>) which does the same sort of
thing.</P>

<P>The theory on these devices is this. What we call "brainwaves" are
the overall resonant properties of neural networks which, to a
certain extent, behave like oscillators. Like most oscillators, these
can be driven externally, and in this case, the best way to do so is
via the eyes and ears. Flashing lights are known to affect brainwave
activity, as are pulsing sounds (especially when a beat frequency is
applied between the two ears). Epileptics are particularly
susceptible to this, and most people are susceptible to the so-called
"photic driving" effect, which can induce nausea and confusion using
only flashing light and sound.</P>

<P>In other words, flashing lights and pulsing sounds can potentiate
oscillations in the brain's neural networks in much the same way that
one pushes a child on a swing. At precisely the right moment, a
little push adds to the energy of the oscillator and keeps it going.
Light and Sound machines apply just the right push at the right time
to enhance brainwave activity in particular frequencies.</P>

<P>Using these devices, one can potentiate activity at various
brainwave frequencies. Thus far the most commonly discussed brainwave
frequencies (or more accurately frequency ranges) are alpha, theta,
beta, delta, and sigma. The presence or absence of a given brainwave
frequency is an indication of mental state, and by inducing brainwave
activity, one can enhance those mental states.</P>

<P>A quick over-simplified summary of brainwave bands:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Alpha waves</B> range from 8 to 12 Hz (cycles per second).
   Alpha waves appear to be associated with meditative and hypnotic
   states and sleep. One study on brainwaves and golf (<A HREF="refs.html#r356">356</A>)
   found that alpha activity seems to be a good predictor for
   accurate putting; others have suggested that alpha waves tend to
   occur while one is absorbed in physical or mental tasks.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Beta waves</B> range from 20 to 28 Hz and appear to be
   associated with active concentration and thought.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Theta waves</B> range from 3 to 8 Hz, and seem to arise
   from a hippocampal circuit, possibly with the help of a circuit in
   the brainstem (<A HREF="refs.html#r358">358</A>). Theta waves tend
   to decrease immediately before volitional movements, and are
   probably an indicator of a closed feedback loop in the limbic
   system. The theta rhythm may help to encode spatial and/or
   temporal information (<A HREF="refs.html#r359">359</A>).
   Interestingly, the prohormone DHEA increases theta activity
   (<A HREF="refs.html#r357">357</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Delta waves</B>, 0.3 to 3 Hz, typically occur only during
   non-REM sleep. NMDA antagonists (presumably including DXM) greatly
   increase delta waves during subsequent non-REM sleep (<A HREF="refs.html#r360">360</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Sigma waves</B>, 10 to 15 Hz, seem to occur primarily
   during sleep.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Gamma waves</B>, 30Hz and above, may reflect certain
   aspects of the cognitive process.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The two important brainwave bands for DXM users are theta and
alpha. Light and/or sound stimulation at these frequencies has been
reported to induce a variety of interesting altered states of
consciousness which are, for the most part, indescribable.</P>

<P>Theta stimulation in particular has been reported to generate
fantastic results. Here is a description of one person's DXM plus
theta stimulation experience:<BR>
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I used the program "FLASHER" set at 6Hz, turned off the
   lights, and stared at the screen. At first it just looked like a
   big flashing computer screen, but gradually I noticed that I was
   perceiving the light and dark phases separately. The flashes
   seemed to get brighter and brighter, and last longer and longer.
   Everything kept building up in intensity, and it was starting to
   get somewhat scary, when all of a sudden the flashing just ...
   stopped. It was all white light, and I felt my soul being tugged
   out of my body. From then on it got really weird ...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>WARNING: Brainwave stimulation, especially in the alpha band,
can induce siezures in epileptics.</B> If you are, or suspect you
might be, epileptic, don't use light and sound machines! DXM may
actually decrease the seizure threshold, so be very, very
careful.</P>

<P><BR>
DXM, unlike LSD, doesn't tend to lend itself as much to trip toys. By
the time you've reached a sufficient dose to get strong psychedelic
effects, you probably won't want to move around much. However, some
people seem to enjoy trip toys with DXM, ranging from art supplies to
slinkies. I can't really offer suggestions here, except to find what
you like and have fun with it. One person reports a device called the
"LSD Flight Simulator", an inexpensive gadget, works well to induce
closed-eye hallucinations.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.5.1 &nbsp; Heavy Exercise</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Most individuals who have exercised under the influence of DXM have
reported negative effects such as nausea, vomiting, cramping, and a
general loss of the more enjoyable aspects of the trip. This seems to
become more and more significant with higher doses of DXM. The one
exception seems to be swimming, which if done on a first plateau DXM
dose can be enjoyable.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.5.2 &nbsp; Driving</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM is an intoxicating drug, and no intoxicating drug should be used
when you are driving. Ever. If you're pulled over, the cops will know
you are on something, as DXM strongly interferes with normal eye
movements at recreational levels. They may not know what you're on,
but they can still bust you, and even if you never get formally
charged, this is definitely not a fun tripping experience.</P>

<P>Not to mention, by driving (or operating heavy machinery) on DXM
you are placing yourself and potentially a lot of other people at
risk. The highways are full of enough carnage as it is, and there's
no excuse for adding to it. Quite frankly I think that anyone who
drives while intoxicated (on anything) is committing an act of
attempted manslaughter (if not murder) and repeat offenders should be
charged and tried as such. That's probably an extreme position, but I
think far too many people are willing to blame the alcohol (or drug)
for the user's arrogance and stupidity.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.5.3 &nbsp; Going to Class, School, or Work on
DXM</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Many people have had the experience of going to classes drunk,
stoned, or otherwise intoxicated. Going to class on a low dose of DXM
should be fairly similar. Once probably won't hurt you, although it
certainly isn't going to help you either. Doing this regularly is
definitely bad news, as DXM will interfere with memory when used
regularly, and may cause cognitive impairment with long-term use.
High doses of DXM are even worse, since the dissociative effects can
lead to highly inappropriate behavior. To top it off, as it becomes
more difficult to judge the appropriateness of behavior, the fear at
doing something that will get you laughed at (or worse) can make a
trip turn unpleasant.</P>

<P>A special note for people still in high school (or younger): don't
do DXM, or any other drug, in school. Yes, school can really suck.
The classes are boring, repetitive, unchallenging, and full of
potentially useless information. The teachers are often (but not
always!) more interested in hearing you regurgitate facts than have
an original thought. The administrators generally aren't interested
in you as a person, they're interested in making sure the school runs
smoothly and that they get paid. And your peers usually don't give a
rat's ass about your feelings; they're too busy coping with newly
found hormones and playing Cooler Than Thou. And so, I might add, are
you, in all likelihood.</P>

<P>During this time, many students with half a brain in their heads
end up going through the usual sort of teenage existential angst
(you'll know it when you get there). This is, I think, one of the
rites of passage of today's youth, which has the potential to
liberate one from being completely under the control of what one's
peers think of as cool. It also has the potential to get you into a
lot of trouble, especially with drugs, and DXM is no exception.</P>

<P>Don't get me wrong; I don't think drug use is inherently any more
or less wrong for teenagers than for adults. In practicality,
however, one needs a certain level of emotional and intellectual (and
possibly physical) maturity before responsible drug use becomes
likely. And responsible people know there are times and places not to
use intoxicating or otherwise mind-altering substances.</P>

<P>So in the mean time, avoid using drugs in school. Many of your
teachers and administrators will know (they may seem dumb as a post.
Don't believe it). Your grades will probably suffer, and for all
their seeming irrelevancy, good grades are really one of the better
tickets out of a life of boredom. You may also develop a stubborn
habit, as the use of a drug becomes associated with the everyday
activity of going to school. Finally, the bad trip potential
shouldn't be ignored.</P>

<P>As for what to do instead, well, there's no easy answers there.
Some people find fulfillment in reading Sartre and Thoreau, others in
reading X-Men and romance novels. Regular exercise really does help,
as with so many other problems in life, and it helps one to cope with
boredom and mundanity. Don't neglect your mind either, even if your
teachers do; you can be your own teacher (and a damned good one at
that). Question everyone and everything; it's the only way to learn.
And above all else, try to keep a sense of humor; things that seem
vastly important now will seem a lot less serious in a few years.</P>

<P>Obviously, the same advice goes for using DXM at work. Unless your
job is considerably different than most I've ever encountered, DXM
won't help your performance and will probably seriously impair it. So
unless you want to end up unemployed, save the psychedelics for
weekends and vacations.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.5.4 &nbsp; Dose "Boosting" and Re-dosing</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
This issue is considerably more complex than I'd originally realized.
Generally speaking, taking a booster dose is not a good idea and
probably won't do what you want. It <I>is</I> possible to jump from
the first plateau to the second, and from the second to the third,
with a booster dose. However, it doesn't always work, and generally
speaking you can't sustain a given plateau (except the first plateau,
although that's difficult).</P>

<P>With a great degree of practice, you can probably become adept at
gauging how much DXM to take for a booster dose. However, it seems to
take a lot of practice. You'd probably be better off picking the
dosage at the beginning and sticking with it.</P>

<P>Besides, as the duration of the trip is extended with dose
boosting or redosing, the dysphoric aspects of the experience
increase, until eventually most people report feeling like the
walking dead. Not to mention by extending the duration of the trip
you are increasing the chance for adverse effects and brain
damage.</P>

<P>The one exception to all this seems to be a first plateau dose,
which (with practice) can be maintained for some time, leading to a
prolonged stimulant effect. This is probably due to the dopamine
reuptake inhibiting effect of DXM (absent with DXO), similar to that
of bupropion (Wellbutrin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) or
cocaine. Prolonging this will, however, intensify the "crash" and is
probably not a good idea.</P>

<H3><CENTER>7.5.5 &nbsp; Stressful Environments</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Many DXM users report that stressful environments can induce bad
trips, dysphoria, and panic attacks. This is nothing new to
psychedelics, of course, but DXM seems to be more capable of it than
LSD.</P>

<H2><CENTER>7.6 &nbsp; What is the "50 Trip Limit" and How Can I
Avoid It?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Recently someone pointed out to me that most of the psychedelic and
interesting effects of DXM seemed to go away with repeated use, and
hadn't returned. He suggested a limit of about 50 trips; i.e., you
get roughly 50 DXM trips before the magic is gone. Other people have
said similar things, although the exact number seems to vary from
person to person. A few seem to be able to use DXM repeatedly without
ever losing the more interesting psychedelic qualitiies.</P>

<P>There are a number of possible explanations for the "50 trip
limit". Here are a few I came up with, as well as potential
solutions.</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Long-lasting tolerance. Some people have noticed a tolerance
   of up to a *year* to the more pleasant effects of DXM. Why this
   is, I don't know; nor do I know any way to reverse it.</LI>
   
   <LI>Disruption of enzyme systems. It is possible that the P450
   enzyme system is disrupted for long periods of time by DXM,
   although I don't see why this would happen. This could last for
   quite some time, potentially permanently. It's also possible that
   a conversion enzyme is *induced* so that the DXM is converted to a
   metabolite too rapidly. Nothing to be done about this that I know
   of.</LI>
   
   <LI>State-dependent memory. When you first do DXM, you are in a
   completely new and wonderful state, and you don't really
   "integrate" the memories of the non-drug states (including the
   unpleasantness of drinking cough syrup). As you begin to trip more
   and more often, environmental cues help you to integrate the
   drug-state and the non-drug-state. Eventually you will learn to
   associate the drug not only with the pleasant effects but also
   with the unpleasantness of taking it, something which doesn't
   happen early on due to DXM's ability to inhibit memory.
   
   <P>Try taking DXM in a *completely* new environment and see if
   that changes anything. Make sure to do a *low* dose first, though;
   if there is a state-dependent tolerance, you could go way too high
   accidentally if in a new environment.</P></LI>
   
   <LI>Hallucinogen antidependency. This is a common phenomenon with
   most psychedelics. After using any psychedelic several dozen
   times, the magic is gone. It just becomes familiar territory, and
   with the "wow" factor from the novelty gone, the more mundane
   aspects (confusion, nausea) of the trip intrude. The solution to
   this, if there is one, is to put your own "magic" into the
   experience by interacting with people, trying new experiences,
   etc. (but don't drive!)</LI>
   
   <LI>Problems with an ingredient in cough syrups. It's possible
   that the gut, liver, or kidneys start to have trouble metabolizing
   all the gunk in cough syrups. Try using DXM extract.</LI>
   
   <LI>Age. DXM becomes increasingly less pleasurable as one gets
   older. No solution that I know of, except possibly to make sure
   you are physically fit before tripping.</LI>
   
   <LI>Brain damage. I've seen no evidence for this except with very
   frequent high-dose use (e.g., third or fourth plateau several
   times a week for several months); furthermore, people who do
   report DXM becoming less pleasant with time haven't said it's that
   much faster with high dose trips (whereas any brain damage problem
   would be). Technically speaking, the damage that Olney et al found
   with dissociatives is way *beyond* the fourth plateau dosage
   level, and I'm not convinced that normal users would ever
   experience it.</LI>
   
   <LI>Cigarettes or other drugs. If you've changed your drug-taking
   habits, this may affect DXM's effects.
