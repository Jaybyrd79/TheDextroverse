<H3><CENTER>10.1.1 &nbsp; The Structure of a Nerve Cell</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
All cells have a <I>voltage gradient</I> between the outside and the
inside of the cell; if you were to measure the voltage between the
inside and outside of the cell you would find that the inside of the
cell is somewhat less than -100mV compared to the outside of the
cell. In most cells this charge is a consequence of the pumping of
ions into and out of the cell, and is not used for anything in
particular. Muscle and nerve cells, however, make use of this
charge.</P>

<P>Muscle cells and nerve cells (<I>neurons</I>) have "excitable"
membranes -- that is, the charge across the cell membrane can change,
and this change is used for specific purposes. In neurons, a drop in
this charge is used to convey a signal.</P>

<P>There are more than 10 billion nerve cells in the human brain, and
they all do the same job: conveying signals from their inputs
(dendrites) to outputs (axons). A nerve cell looks a little bit like
a tree, except that instead of roots and branches, a nerve cell has
<I>dendrites</I> and <I>axons</I>. Generally speaking, the dendrites
receive signals and the axons transmit them (remember, a signal is
indicated by a change in cell membrane voltage).</P>

<P>At the end of each branch of the axon is a <I>synaptic bouton</I>,
a small button-like structure which is used to send a signal to the
next nerve cell (more on that later). Conversely, the dendrites are
used to receive signals, and contain numerous little bumps, knobs,
and such that each receive a signal from another neuron. One neuron
may receive signals from thousands of other neurons.</P>

<P>Some of the signals may excite the cell membrane; others may
inhibit it. If the sum of excitatory minus inhibitory signals
received by the dendrites is large enough, the signal will reach the
nerve cell body (<I>soma</I>). Once a strong enough signal is
received by the soma, it is sent out along the axons and
transmitted.</P>

<P>This is the basis for how neurons function individually. However,
it doesn't explain how one neuron sends signals to another (or
conversely, how they receive signals). A very few neurons are
physically joined to each other, and signals simply cross from one
cell to another just as the signals from one transistor cross to
another inside a microchip. However, the majority of neurons don't
touch each other; instead, they communicate with chemicals called
<I>neurotransmitters</I> and receive them with structures called
<I>neuroreceptors</I></P>

<H3><CENTER>10.1.2 &nbsp; Neurotransmission</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
A <I>receptor</I> is a structure on the surface of, or inside, a
cell. If on a nerve cell (neuron), it is often called a
<I>neuroreceptor</I>. Receptors exist to receive signals from
particular chemicals, and when they receive these signals they
generally exert some sort of change on the function of the cell. Some
receptors are present inside the cell and are called <I>intracellular
receptors</I>; many receptors for steroids (testosterone, estrogen,
etc.) are intracellular.</P>

<P>Since this chapter is about neuropharmacology, the focus will be
on neuroreceptors, usually referred to herein simply as receptors.
Neuroreceptors exist on the surface of (or, more rarely, inside)
nerve cells and respond to chemicals called <I>neurotransmitters</I>.
Some neurotransmitters also act on cells other than nerve cells; for
example, acetylcholine activates receptors on muscle cells, telling
them to contract.</P>

<P>Neurotransmitters fit into receptors like keys into a lock, and do
not, in general, fit into any other receptor. Thus we have
acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and acetylcholine receptors. Some
receptors (called <I>ion channel receptors</I>) when activated will
stimulate or depress the membrane potential (and thus the nerve
cell's activity); others (<I>metabotropic</I> receptors) will induce
changes in in the characteristics of the cell. Some ion channel
receptors (calcium channels) can do both.</P>

<P>Generally speaking, a receptor on a nerve cell is positioned so
that it can receive signals from another nerve cell. Dendrites of
course have receptors, but receptors can also exist on the cell body,
on axons, or on synaptic boutons. The "interface" between the two
nerve cells is called a <I>synapse</I>. <IMG SRC="figure7.gif" WIDTH=232 HEIGHT=275 ALIGN=left vspace=4 hspace=4></P>

<P>The ion channel neuroreceptors typically operate very quickly, and
act (and look) somewhat like an iris shutter in a camera. The
neurotransmitter (for example, acetylcholine) binds to a specific
area on the channel, which (due to electrostatic forces) causes the
channel to snap open. Specific ions then leak into and out of the
nerve cell, changing its electrical potential. Different channels
allow different ions to pass; some ions (like sodium) excite the
nerve cell, others (like potassium and chloride) inhibit it. Once the
neurotransmitter leaves the receptor, the channel snaps shut, having
done its work. These are the receptors involved in fast signal
transmission, and in conveying skeletal muscle impulses.</P>

<P>The metabotropic receptors have a modulatory role. Some of them
increase or decrease the number of other types of receptors. Some
cause changes in genetic expression in the cell. Some (called
autoreceptors) inhibit the release of their own matching
neurotransmitter, a process called negative feedback. A thermostat is
an example of a negative feedback system -- the hotter it gets, the
less the furnace is on. Generally, these slower domain receptors
operate by second messengers (which function as messengers within the
cell) such as G-proteins.</P>

<P>Any given neurotransmitter will probably be associated with
several different receptors. For example, serotonin (5HT) activates
at least twelve receptor subtypes (5HT<SUB>1A</SUB>,
5HT<SUB>1B</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>1D</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>1E</SUB>,
5HT<SUB>1F</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>2A</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>2C</SUB>,
5HT<SUB>3</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>4</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>5</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>6</SUB>,
and 5HT<SUB>7</SUB>)! There are several subtypes (instead of just
one) because each receptor subtype is involved in a different process
on a different type of neuron.</P>

<P>Drugs act on the brain by affecting neurotransmission in some way
or another. Some drugs stimulate receptors, some block them; some
will change the way that neurotransmitters are secreted, degraded, or
recycled. To a great degree, drugs work only because they affect
existing neurotransmitter systems; in spite of the popular belief
that getting high equates to frying brain cells, drugs that make you
high do so simply by mimicking, blocking, or otherwise affecting
neurotransmission.</P>

<P>Drugs which mimic, block, or otherwise affect activity of a given
neurotransmitter will not affect all receptor subtypes equally. For
example, LSD operates at 5HT<SUB>2A</SUB> and 5HT<SUB>2C</SUB>
receptors; buspirone operates at 5HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors.
Consequently, they have very different effects; LSD is psychedelic,
whereas buspirone is an anti-anxiety drug.</P>

<P>Different substances may bind to the same receptor but affect it
differently. An <I>agonist</I> is a substance which binds to the
receptor and activates it. A <I>partial agonist</I> is an agonist
which does not activate the receptor fully. An <I>antagonist</I>
binds to the receptor and prevents it from operating.</P>

<P>One interesting property of partial agonists is that they tend to
"normalize" receptor activity levels. In the presence of a low amount
of neurotransmitter, the partial agonist will increase receptor
function. In the presence of a high amount of neurotransmitter,
however, the partial agonist will limit receptor activity; in fact,
many antagonists may really be partial agonists. It is still being
debated as to whether LSD is a 5HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonist or a
partial agonist.</P>

<P>Antagonists may bind to the same place where the neurotransmitter
binds, thus "competing" with the neurotransmitter - these are called
<I>competitive antagonists</I>. Or they may bind to a separate place
on the receptor complex, so that even if the neurotransmitter reaches
its binding site, the receptor won't activate. These are called
<I>noncompetitive antagonists</I>. Note that in either case, the
binding of the drug is only temporary; if it were permanent (thus
effectively destroying the receptor) it would be <I>irreversible
antagonism</I>.</P>

<P>The important difference between a competitive and a
noncompetitive antagonist is this. If you block receptors with a
competitive antagonist, these receptors can still be activated by
neurotransmitters if enough neurotransmitter is secreted. If you
block a receptor with a noncompetitive antagonist, however, no amount
of neurotransmitter will activate that receptor (until the
noncompetitive antagonist goes away).</P>

<P>A rather whimsical analogy can be made between neurotransmitter
functioning and toilets. In this case, the toilet is the receptor,
you are the neurotransmitter, activating it by pushing the flush
handle. If your little brother comes up and flushes the toilet for
you, he's is an agonist. If he temporarily sticks the handle halfway
down, he's a partial agonist. If he holds the handle up so it won't
flush, he's a competitive antagonist. If he plugs up the toilet with
toilet paper, he's a noncompetitive antagonist. If he breaks the
toilet handle off completely, he's an irreversible antagonist.</P>

<P>The <I>biogenic amine</I> neurotransmitters (so called because
they are in a chemical class called amines) include
<I>acetylcholine,</I> <I>noradrenaline</I>, <I>dopamine,
serotonin</I> (5HT), and <I>histamine</I>. They are derived from
amino acids (choline, tyrosine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine
respectively), generally have a modulatory role, and are the common
targets of recreational drugs. For example: LSD, DMT, and psilocybin
target 5HT receptors; amphetamine causes a release of dopamine and
noradrenaline; cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine (thus keeping
it active longer); MDMA causes a release of 5HT and dopamine; etc. A
mostly complete list of recreational drugs and their neuroreceptor
activity is given in <A HREF="appendices.html#toc.15.2">Section
15.2</A>.</P>

<P>The <I>neuropeptide</I> neurotransmitters include a whole slew of
peptides (chains of amino acids), such as neuropeptide Y,
angiotensin, endorphins, substance P, and so on. The only
recreational drugs targeting neuropeptide receptors are the opiates,
which target the mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. Opioid
receptors are (obviously) involved in pain and behavioural
reinforcement. Vasopressin, a nootropic ("Smart Drug") is also a
peptide neurotransmitter.</P>

<P>The <I>amino acid</I> neurotransmitters include <I>GABA</I>
(gamma-aminobutyric acid), <I>glutamate</I>, and <I>aspartate</I>.
Receptors for these neurotransmitters include the GABA receptors
(which come in two main flavors) for GABA, and the NMDA, AMPA
(formerly quisqualate), kainate, and metabotropic receptors (all of
which respond to glutamate and aspartate). The GABA receptor is the
target of benzodiazepines like diazepam
(Valium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>), barbiturates, and
alcohol; the NMDA receptor is targeted by PCP, ketamine, alcohol, and
DXM.</P>

<P>And then there are those receptors that don't really fit in
anywhere else. The anandamine receptor is the recently-identified
target for the THC in marijuana. The adenosine receptor, which tends
to inhibit nerve activity, is blocked by caffeine (by which it exerts
its stimulant effect). The sigma receptor was originally classified
as an opioid receptor, but is now thought to be separate.
Gamma-hydroxybutyrate, GHB, seems to target a specific receptor as
well.</P>

<P>Each receptor can have more than one binding site (a place where a
drug can bind to, generally affecting the activity of the receptor).
For example, the NMDA channel/receptor complex has seven (glutamate,
glycine, magnesium ion, zinc ion, PCP open channel site, polyamine
site, and phosphorylation site). Most have fewer than this; the NMDA
channel is an extremely complicated receptor.</P>

<P><I>Voltage Dependent Ion Channels</I> are similar to the
fast-domain, shutter-like receptors, except that they are opened by
voltage potentials across the cell membrane. They usually transmit
signals along nerve fibers, or cause the end of an axon to release
its neurotransmitter. Sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride
(Na<SUP>+</SUP>, K<SUP>+</SUP>, Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>, and Cl<SUP>-</SUP>)
are the usual ions in question. Tetrodotoxin, the active ingredient
in "zombie powder", is a sodium channel blocker. The NMDA receptor
has some features of a voltage dependent ion channel (see below).</P>

<H2><CENTER>10.2 &nbsp; What are Sigma Receptors?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Discovered in 1976, sigma receptors (sigma is often written in Greek
-- &sigma; -- and if your web browser accepted that, you're luckier
than I am) are currently one of the most confusing entities in
neuropharmacology. Our knowledge of sigma receptors pales in
comparison to our ignorance; in fact, what we absolutely know (or at
least think we absolutely know) can be summed up very briefly in the
following paragraph:</P>

<P>Scattered throughout the brain and body there are places (sigma
binding sites) where a bunch of chemicals (sigma ligands) happen to
stick. We don't know if they're on the outside or inside of cells. We
don't know if sticking a chemical to them does anything or not,
except in the vas deferens. We don't really know what they do, if
they do anything. We don't know what they're for, why they're there,
or whether the body uses them. They may be neuroreceptors, steroid
receptors, intracellular messenger receptors, growth regulators,
enzymes, or something else entirely.</P>

<P>In other words, prepare to be confused. Don't worry, everyone else
is as well.</P>

<P>Sigma receptors were originally thought of as opioid receptors,
since many morphine derivatives bind there (<A HREF="refs.html#r283">283</A>).
However, this classification is probably false, and the endogenous
opioid peptides show little sigma activity. The usual characteristics
of opiates are mediated by the mu (&mu;), kappa (&kappa;), and delta
(&delta;) receptors. There are at least two sigma receptors, and a
third one (sigma<SUB>3</SUB>, appropriately enough) has been
discovered recently (<A HREF="refs.html#r114">114</A>).</P>

<P>Some researchers have speculated that sigma receptors aren't
really receptors at all, but just enzyme binding sites (<A HREF="refs.html#r84">84</A>).
On the other hand, sigma ligands affect the guinea pig vas deferens
muscles, which probably wouldn't happen unless sigma receptors really
were receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r97">97</A>). Sigma receptors may
be intended for hormones or intracellular messengers rather than
neurotransmitters, as they are present on microsomes rather than on
the cell surface (<A HREF="refs.html#r129">129</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>10.2.1 &nbsp; Sigma 1 Receptors and General Sigma
Information</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Much of what is known about sigma receptors seems to apply more to
sigma<SUB>1</SUB> than sigma<SUB>2</SUB> (though this is by no means
universal). I grouped the following information with
sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors, but don't take this as gospel. I expect
that a lot will turn out to be wrong. Fortunately, we may not have to
wait long; research in sigma receptors is proceeding rapidly.</P>

<H3><CENTER>10.2.1.1 &nbsp; Endogenous Ligands</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The neurotransmitter for sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors has not been
found, although there are speculations and evidence (<A HREF="refs.html#r82">82-86</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r98">98-99</A>).
The usual term for the (unidentified) sigma<SUB>1</SUB>
neurotransmitter is "endopsychosin" (<A HREF="refs.html#r99">99</A>),
formerly known as "angeldustin". Progesterone targets
sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors in the placenta, and it and other steroid
hormones may be natural ligands for sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors
(<A HREF="refs.html#r97">97</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r102">102</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r103">103</A>).
If this is true, it is possible that some of the effects of sex
hormones on the brain may be mediated by the sigma<SUB>1</SUB>
receptor (<A HREF="refs.html#r97">97</A>). Substance P (a peptide
neurotransmitter) was considered but rejected as an endogenous
sigma<SUB>1</SUB> ligand (<A HREF="refs.html#r111">111</A>). DHEA may
be a sigma<SUB>1</SUB> agonist, and progesterone an antagonist
(<A HREF="refs.html#r258">258</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>10.2.1.2 &nbsp; Location and Function in the
Brain</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Sigma receptors are densest in the cerebellar cortex (<A HREF="refs.html#r281">281</A>),
nucleus accumbens, and cortex, and also present at lower density in
the limbic areas and extrapyramidal motor system (<A HREF="refs.html#r260">260</A>).
This is interesting because some of the bizarre effects of DXM on
motion may be related to sigma activity in the cerebellar cortex and
extrapyramidal motor system.</P>

<P>Sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors (and possibly sigma<SUB>2</SUB>)
appear to be functionally coupled to some other receptors, notably
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r97">97</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r116">116</A>)
and NMDA receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r106">106-109</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r275">275</A>).
They may actually be located on or near NMDA receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r222">222</A>).</P>

<P>The nicotinic receptor coupling may be direct, with sigma
activation causing a change in the function of nicotinic receptors.
Whether modulation of nicotinic receptors would alter the effects of
nicotine on the brain, I don't know; some people have indicated that
tobacco induces strong responses during DXM use.</P>

<P>Sigma agonists (and/or possibly antagonists) seem to affect memory
function, reversing the impairment in memory caused by drugs such as
p-chloroamphetamine and MK-801 (a drug similar to ketamine)
(<A HREF="refs.html#r130">130</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r131">131</A>).
DTG, (+)-pentazocine, and SKF-10047 all improved memory impairment
caused by MK-801. On the other hand, NE-100, which is considered a
sigma antagonist, seems to help with NMDA antagonist induced memory
impairment as well (<A HREF="refs.html#r106">106-107</A>). DTG, a
sigma agonist, reversed the memory impairment caused by carbon
monoxide (<A HREF="refs.html#r117">117</A>).</P>

<P>Many drugs now considered sigma antagonists or agonists may in
fact be partial agonists. Another possibility is that the optimal
level of sigma activity may be a healthy medium; one study found a
bell-curve dose response on sigma agonists (<A HREF="refs.html#r117">117</A>).
This is similar to the effect of many nootropics (smart drugs),
specifically the cholinergics - taking too much can be worse than
taking none at all. This similarity may be further evidence for the
link between sigma receptors and acetylcholine receptors.</P>

<P>Both sigma<SUB>1</SUB> agonists and antagonists may protect NMDA
receptors from glutamate toxicity (<A HREF="refs.html#r108">108</A>).
One study found that sigma antagonists protected hippocampal cells
from hypoxia and hypoglycemia (<A HREF="refs.html#r104">104</A>), and
this may be related to NMDA receptors as well. Morphine has indirect
effect on NMDA receptors that seems to be mediated via sigma
receptors, probably sigma<SUB>1</SUB> (<A HREF="refs.html#r109">109</A>).
It is possible that all these effects are mediated via the nicotinic
receptor, i.e., sigma<SUB>1</SUB> may not directly control NMDA
functioning.</P>

<H3><CENTER>10.2.1.3 &nbsp; Behavioural Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The behavioral effects of sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors have not been
fully established. However, sigma<SUB>1</SUB> (and sigma<SUB>2</SUB>)
receptors seem to have effects on motor function, producing an
increase in locomotion (<A HREF="refs.html#r112">112</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r113">113</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r120">120</A>).
Part of this effect may occur at the cerebellum (<A HREF="refs.html#r112">112</A>);
the release of dopamine may also be involved (<A HREF="refs.html#r113">113</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r128">128</A>).
This is probably the origin of DXM's curious effects on motions and
gait, including "sea legs" and the "Robo Shuffle".</P>

<P>Sigma<SUB>1</SUB> activation may counteract some of the analgesic
effects of opioids (<A HREF="refs.html#r118">118</A>). Pentazocine
(Talwin), a synthetic opiate, is a potent sigma<SUB>1</SUB> agonist
which tends to be self-limiting; when too much is taken, the sigma
activity reverses the opiate activity (<A HREF="refs.html#r267">267</A>).
It is possible that the gradual loss of euphoric effects experienced
by morphine and heroin users may be related to changes caused by
sigma activity.</P>

<P>Sigma receptors seem to be involved in psychotomimetic (literally
"psychosis-like") effects from schizophrenia and drugs (<A HREF="refs.html#r46">46-49</A>).
Amphetamine psychosis, a temporary condition resulting from heavy use
of psychostimulants, may be due in part to sigma<SUB>1</SUB> activity
(<A HREF="refs.html#r80">80</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r125">125</A>).
Sigma, and in particular sigma<SUB>1</SUB>, receptors may be altered
by schizophrenia. An alternative possibility which is being studied
is that some sort of chemical - produced by the body itself, or by a
virus or other foreign agent - causes prolonged activation of sigma
receptors, and this is one of the causes for schizophrenia (<A HREF="refs.html#r47">47</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r49">49</A>).
Many neuroleptics, including some of the atypical ones, are sigma
antagonists (<A HREF="refs.html#r47">47</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r260">260</A>).
Some antidepressants are also sigma antagonists, and all eventually
reduce sigma binding (<A HREF="refs.html#r260">260</A>).
Methamphetamine increases sigma binding (<A HREF="refs.html#r211">211</A>).</P>

<P>Sigma receptors may be involved in the function of the pineal
gland, an endocrine gland which secretes melatonin (which maintains
the "biological clock"). Sigma activity modulates the
noradrenaline-stimulated synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland
(<A HREF="refs.html#r256">256</A>), and there are in fact sigma
receptors within the pineal gland (<A HREF="refs.html#r266">266</A>).</P>

<P>In addition to DXM, other recreational drugs such as PCP, cocaine,
and opiates all show activity at sigma receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r72">72</A>).
Chronic amphetamine use increases the number of sigma receptors
(<A HREF="refs.html#r80">80</A>), while chronic antidepressant and
antipsychotic treatments decrease the number of sigma receptors
(<A HREF="refs.html#r47">47</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r74">74</A>).
Sigma receptors are involved in the limbic areas of the brain
(<A HREF="refs.html#r81">81</A>) and thus may be involved in emotion.
They are also involved in the cough reflex, and probably involved in
seizures (or at least their prevention).</P>

Body</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors are also present throughout the body.
Most tumor cells express both sigma<SUB>1</SUB> and sigma<SUB>2</SUB>
receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r38">38</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r105">105</A>),
and sigma agonists can inhibit tumor growth (<A HREF="refs.html#r269">269</A>).
Liver and kidney cells also contain sigma receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r123">123</A>),
as do heart cells (<A HREF="refs.html#r124">124</A>), and splenocytes
(<A HREF="refs.html#r274">274</A>). As stated above, the placenta
contains sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors.</P>

<P>Sigma receptors are also present in the immune system and
endocrine glands, and may be responsible for modulating these
systems. Sigma agonists can prevent rejection of grafted tissue by
regulating T cells (<A HREF="refs.html#r263">263</A>). There is some
evidence that sigma agonists may inhibit the immune system. The
widespread presence of sigma receptors may indicate some involvement
in development, cellular regulation, or other basic biological
process.</P>

<H3><CENTER>10.2.2 &nbsp; Sigma 2 Receptors</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Much of what was stated about sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptors may apply
to sigma<SUB>2</SUB> receptors as well. There hasn't been much time
to differentiate between the two receptor types. The neurotransmitter
for sigma<SUB>2</SUB> receptors may be zinc ions (<A HREF="refs.html#r78">78</A>),
and sigma<SUB>2</SUB> receptors seem related to potassium ion
channels (<A HREF="refs.html#r79">79</A>). The sigma<SUB>2</SUB>
receptor is less affected by DXM than the sigma<SUB>1</SUB> receptor
(<A HREF="refs.html#r58">58</A>). Some of the sigma-induced
potentiation of NMDA function may be due to sigma<SUB>2</SUB>
receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r116">116</A>). Ibogaine, currently
being tested as a cure for heroin addiction, is a sigma<SUB>2</SUB>
agonist (<A HREF="refs.html#r273">273</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r283">283</A>).
Other ligands for the sigma<SUB>2</SUB> receptor have been found
(<A HREF="refs.html#r261">261</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r265">265</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r268">268</A>).</P>

<P>One study found that chronic exposure to sigma ligands, both
agonists and antagonists, caused brain cells to degenerate and die
(<A HREF="refs.html#r101">101</A>). The deterioration occurred as a
gradual loss of cellular shape; cells eventually became spherical
(and died soon after). Interestingly, some drugs, including DXM,
seemed to be very weak in this effect. While haloperidol induced
significant changes and cell death in a few hours, it took DXM 3 days
to produce any changes at all, which reversed when the DXM was
removed. The potency of different sigma ligands seems to point
towards sigma<SUB>2</SUB> receptors as the culprit in this
effect.</P>

<P>By the way, I wouldn't worry too much about this. The
concentration of DXM required to induce any change at all was
extremely high, and it took 3 days of constant exposure. All changes
were reversible, even after the cells had assumed a spherical shape.
Haloperidol and other sigma ligands, which seem to be up to 100 times
as potent as DXM at producing brain cell degeneration, are used
medically used without substantial evidence of brain damage. Finally,
steroid hormones may very well cause the same sort of effects if
present at sufficient levels (another reason not to use anabolic
steroids, I guess).</P>

<P><BR>
Sigma<SUB>3</SUB> receptors are a new discovery (<A HREF="refs.html#r114">114</A>).
They seem to be linked to the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine, and
sigma<SUB>3</SUB> agonists may increase the rate of dopamine
synthesis. DXM's potency at the sigma<SUB>3</SUB> receptor is
unknown, but if it binds strongly there, then increased dopamine
synthesis may be partially responsible for DXM's stimulant effects. A

<H3><CENTER>10.3.1 &nbsp; NMDA and Other Glutamate
Receptors</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Most of the better known neurotransmitter systems - dopamine,
noradrenaline, serotonin (5HT), and acetylcholine in particular -
have modulatory roles. They are produced by a few neurons located in
specific clusters, and drugs affecting them often have specific
effects (recreational or medical, or both). Receptors for these
neurotransmitters tend to operate fairly slowly, taking milliseconds
or longer to communicate. Rather than directly changing the potential
of the neuron, they often trigger second-messenger responses.</P>

<P>On the other hand, most of the brain's regular function operates
quickly, and involves the excitatory and inhibitory amino acids (EAAs
and IAAs, respectively). The receptors for amino acids are generally
ion channels; when the receptor is activated, ions enter or exit the
cell which change its potential. EAA and IAA synapses generally
correspond to the positive and negative synaptic connections in
electronic and computer neural networks.</P>

<P>The excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters include glutamate and
aspartate. GABA is the only established inhibitory amino acid
neurotransmitter in the brain; the spinal column also uses glycine.
Generally, glutamate is more prominent (or at least better
understood) than aspartate, although they have similar effects at EAA
receptors. Thus, the receptors for EAAs are called <I>glutamate
receptors</I>.</P>

<P>There are currently four identified type of glutamate receptors.
Two of them, the AMPA (formerly quisqualate) and kainate receptors,
are ion channel receptors which increase neuron activity in response
to EAAs. A third, the metabotropic glutamate receptor, is a newer
discovery, and seems to involve second messenger systems and produce
metabolic effects. The fourth is the NMDA receptor.</P>

<H3><CENTER>10.3.2 &nbsp; NMDA Receptor Structure and
Function</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
This drawing represents the structure of the NMDA receptor, according
to current knowledge. <IMG SRC="figure8.gif" WIDTH=233 HEIGHT=272 ALIGN=left vspace=4 hspace=4></P>

<P>The NMDA receptor has seven distinct binding sites. Three of these
are located on the exterior surface of the cell, two are located on
the cell interior, one on the inside of the channel, and one (the
magnesium ion site) is present both on the inside and outside
surfaces.</P>

<P>There are two agonist sites on the exterior are the cell, denoted
EAA and Gly; they correspond to the excitatory amino acids (glutamate
and aspartate) and glycine. Both sites must be occupied before the
channel can open enough for any ions to pass through. A third site is
the target of zinc ions (Zn<SUP>2+</SUP>), which block the channel
when present.</P>

<P>The exterior of the channel contains a magnesium ion site. This
site is also present on the inside of the cell (alternatively, it may
be located within the channel itself). A magnesium ion normally
occupies the exterior site; the interior site is probably empty under
biological conditions.</P>

<P>The interior of the cell contains two binding sites. One binds to
polyamines (spermine and spermidine), and its function is unknown.
The other, not shown in this diagram, is a phosphorylation site.
Enzymes can bind to this site and enhance or reduce the activity of
the receptor.<BR clear=ALL>
<IMG SRC="figure9.gif" WIDTH=231 HEIGHT=271 ALIGN=left vspace=4 hspace=4>
<IMG SRC="figure10.gif" WIDTH=233 HEIGHT=272 ALIGN=bottom vspace=4 hspace=4><BR clear=ALL>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finally, inside the channel itself is the PCP<SUB>1</SUB> site,
where PCP, ketamine, MK-801 (dizocilpine), DXM, and dextrorphan all
bind. The channel must be fully open for these drugs to enter; once
in place they "clog up" the channel.</P>

<P>NMDA receptors are unique for several reasons. Unlike most
receptors, they require two agonists (glutamate or aspartate, plus
glycine) before the channel opens. These two agonists (Glu and Gly in
the diagram) bind to two different locations on the NMDA receptor.
After both agonists have bound to the channel, it opens enough for
potassium to enter, and the receptor operates much like AMPA and
kainate receptors. This is shown in Figure 9.</P>

<P>The most important and unique characteristic of NMDA receptors,
though, is what happens next (Figure 10). Normally, a magnesium ion
is bound to a specific location at the opening of the channel; this
ion allows potassium to pass through but prevents calcium, possibly
due to its size. This binding is due to electrostatic forces.</P>

<P>Once the cell becomes activated enough, however, the cell
potential rises enough that the magnesium ion is no longer stuck to
the cell. Calcium can enter (and exit, although this doesn't happen)
the cell through the fully open NMDA channel. Once inside, calcium
sets into motion a series of responses which enhance the strength of
the synapse.</P>

<P>So what's the point? Well, if the neuron is only slightly active,
the NMDA channel may open partially, but the magnesium ion won't get
a chance to leave its binding site. However, if the neuron should be
rapidly or substantially activated, the magnesium ion will be
released, and calcium can enter the cell, enhancing synaptic
strength. This process of enhancing synpatic strength, called
<I>Long-Term Potentiation</I> (LTP), is one of the mechanisms by
which neurons can change their functioning and "learn". LTP in the
hippocampus is probably responsible for short-term memory. Learning
capacity may in fact be directly related to the number of NMDA
receptors in the hippocampus (where intermediate-term memory is
thought to be stored) (<A HREF="refs.html#r88">88</A>). LTP is
reversible, and long-term memory seems to be stored via more
permanent changes in genetic expression and synaptic shape.</P>

<P>Another interesting aspect to the dual action of the NMDA receptor
is that it functions as a sort of "coincidence detector". Calcium
only enters the cell when the membrane potential is low enough
<B>and</B> when the synapse is activated; thus it detects when
synaptic and intracellular signals coincide. In associative networks
(which the hippocampus seems to be), the NMDA receptor is ideally
constructed to help a neuron "learn" an association between two input
signals.</P>

<P>There are at least three types of NMDA receptors (in the rat, at
least; this probably extends to humans as well). One type is found in
the cerebellum, one in the thalamus, and one in the cortex. These
types differ subtly, but it is possible that DXM may show a different
spectrum of effect on these types than other NMDA antagonists (such
as ketamine or PCP) (<A HREF="refs.html#r87">87</A>). There is also
some speculation that the NMDA receptor's ion channel may (for
reasons unknown) become "uncoupled" from the receptor itself
(<A HREF="refs.html#r63">63</A>).</P>

<P>Noncompetitive antagonism of NMDA receptors by the open channel
blockers is known to induce changes throughout the brain. NMDA
blockade causes an increase in dopamine release in the midbrain and
prefrontal cortex (<A HREF="refs.html#r63">63</A>). NMDA blockade
also causes activation of 5HT systems specifically targeting the
5HT1A receptor (<A HREF="refs.html#r90">90</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>10.3.3 &nbsp; NMDA Receptors and
Excitotoxicity</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
NMDA receptors are involved in excitotoxicity (nerve cell death via
over-stimulation). The chemicals which agonize (activate) NMDA
receptors can also kill the very same nerve cells they are activating
(<A HREF="refs.html#r19">19</A>). Many substances, such as quinolinic
acid (a metabolite of tryptophan) are so potent that very small
amounts can devastate great numbers nerve cells. Others, like
glutamic and aspartic acid, are less potent but still capable of
doing damage if present in sufficient amounts. This excitotoxicity is
directly responsible for much of the damage attributed to various
types of trauma and insult to the CNS. Polio is a good example; by
blocking the activity of quinolinic acid, all the damage resulting
from poliomyelitis can be prevented (<A HREF="refs.html#r30">30-31</A>).
DXM is not a particularly effective NMDA open channel blocker, but
DXO, PCP, ketamine, and MK-801 (dizocilpine) are all very effective
blockers.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, nothing in life is ever free. Lowered NMDA
activity, called Olney's Lesions, NMDA Receptor Hypofunction (NRH),
or NMDA Antagonist Neurotoxicity (NAN) seems to be itself responsible
for excitotoxicity to other neurons. The theory is that normal NMDA
activity keeps other neurotransmitters (glutamate and acetylcholine,
and possibly dopamine) from being over-secreted. NMDA blockade
releases this inhibition, and can therefore lead to hyperactivity at
some neurons. It is possible that chronic NMDA blockade may be a
cause for, or at least a factor in, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's
disease (<A HREF="refs.html#r100">100</A>).</P>

<P>NMDA blockade at recreational levels has not been well studied,
and Olney's lesions appear only at doses far in excess of
recreational levels. My hunch is that occasional NMDA blockade is
probably not terribly traumatic to the brain; otherwise, John Lilly
would be a lot dumber than he is. DXM in particular may be safer due
to its lower potency at NMDA receptors and possible counteracting
effects of sigma activity. For more information see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.3.1">Section
6.3.1</A>.</P>

<P>One final note: infants may be particularly susceptible to this
effect, so use of any NMDA antagonist during pregnancy or nursing is
probably a bad idea (<A HREF="refs.html#r112">112</A>). It has even
been suggested that fetal alcohol syndrome is mediated in part by the
effects of NMDA blockade.</P>

<H2><CENTER>10.4 &nbsp; What are PCP<SUB>2</SUB>
Receptors?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
PCP<SUB>2</SUB> receptors were, obviously, the second PCP receptor to
be positively identified (the first is the open channel site on the
NMDA receptor). Their use by the body (if they have one) has not been
determined. Most research indicates that the PCP<SUB>2</SUB> receptor
is the dopamine reuptake complex, the very same one targeted by
cocaine and methylphenidate
(Ritalin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) and possibly by the
antidepressant bupropion
(Wellbutrin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) (<A HREF="refs.html#r70">70</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r126">126</A>).</P>

<P>A reuptake complex (or reuptake site), incidentally, is a
structure on a cell which takes used neurotransmitter back into the
cell for recycling or breakdown. By blocking reuptake of a
neurotransmitter, its activity can be increased. The tricyclic
antidepressants block the reuptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, and/or
serotonin (5HT). Fluoxetine
(Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) is a serotonin-specific
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as are several other newer
antidepressants. The dopamine reuptake site seems to be the only
reuptake site targeted by recreational drugs (primarily cocaine).</P>

<P>Curiously, bupropion, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, seems to have
little recreational use potential; then again, it isn't a
particularly strong dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It has been
suggested that it is a competitive reuptake inhibitor, so that it is
only capable of inhibiting reuptake of small amounts of dopamine.
Large amounts of dopamine will overwhelm the effects of the
competitive inhibition. about</P>

<H2><CENTER>10.5 &nbsp; What are Na<SUP>+</SUP> and Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>
Channels?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Sodium and calcium ion channels are two types of voltage dependent
ion channels. These channels open or close not due to
neurotransmitters, but instead due to voltage differences between the
inside and outside of the cell.</P>

<P>Voltage dependent sodium channels are typically involved in the
action potential - a domino-effect propagation of nerve impulses
along the axon. The sodium channel opens when the voltage reaches a
certain activation threshold; the resulting influx of sodium then
further activates the neuron (leading to more sodium channels
opening). Eventually a second part of the sodium channel closes
(otherwise they would keep themselves open forever). Incidentally,
voltage dependent potassium channels are involved in bringing the
neuron back to its resting state.</P>

<P>Voltage dependent calcium channels are similar to voltage
dependent sodium channels, and typically open on activation voltages.
Their effect, however, is to cause calcium to enter the cell; the
calcium then acts as a messenger to intracellular mechanisms. The
most common example is at the end of the axon, where calcium influx
causes neurotransmitters to be released. NMDA receptors may be
structurally related to voltage dependent calcium channels.</P>

<P>DXM has been found to block sodium and calcium channels, although
it is not particularly potent in this capacity. Because of their
extensive presence, blockade of these ion channels could have overall
depressant effect upon brain function, and might explain DXM's toxic
effects at very high dosages.</P>

PCP and ketamine both bind more strongly to NMDA, and less strongly
to the PCP<SUB>2</SUB> and sigma sites, than DXM. In fact, some users
report that DXM, at higher dosages, begins to resemble ketamine and
PCP. The resemblance is still fairly limited. DXM's unique
characteristics are most likely due to the PCP<SUB>2</SUB> and sigma
sites.</P>

<H2><CENTER>10.7 &nbsp; Endopsychosin and the Big
Picture</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
For whatever reason, some people involved in biological sciences like
to talk about the "big picture." I'm one of them. I think the reason
why the "big picture" seems so important is that science, especially
biological science, has become so specialized and compartmentalized
that it's difficult to keep one's perspective, especially when
considering the possible relevance of things.</P>

<P><I>Endopsychosin</I> (en-doe-sy-KOE-sin) is the name given to an
endogenous ligand for the NMDA open channel site (PCP<SUB>1</SUB>)
and/or sigma receptors. The search for endopsychosins started several
years ago in an attempt to find the endogenous ligand for PCP; at the
time, the term was "angeldustin". Recently, the search for
endopsychosins has resumed as NMDA and sigma receptors have become
increasingly understood. As I write this, nobody has managed to
positively identify an endopsychosin, although there are several
candidates. The most promising candidates for the NMDA PCP1 site seem
to be series of peptides (<A HREF="refs.html#r98">98-99</A>). The
endogenous ligand for the sigma<SUB>1</SUB> site may be an unknown
aromatic chemical (<A HREF="refs.html#r97">97</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r99">99</A>).</P>

<P>The original idea behind endopsychosin (or angeldustin, if you
prefer) was that the body was capable of secreting a substance which
would mimic the effects of PCP on the brain. It may be secreted in
times of extreme stress, leading to a sort of detached, dreamy
feeling. Endopsychosin may be responsible for such altered states of
consciousness as religious ecstasy, speaking in tongues, possession,
astral projection, and other paranormal experiences. Spontaneous
releases of endopsychosin may account for experiences such as alien
abductions, encounters with ghosts, and that sort of thing. On the
other hand, these states might be better explained by temporal lobe
complex partial seizures, or other electrical mishaps.</P>

<P>Note the similarity of these experiences with aspects of DXM,
ketamine, and PCP drug trips. In particular, the "emergence
phenomenon" identified with ketamine (and present also with PCP and
DXM) often consists of experiences with spiritual or alien
beings.</P>

<P>What's going on here? Why the hell would the human brain secrete a
chemical that makes us think we've been talking to Elvis and Jim
Morrison on the far side of Mars? What's the big picture?</P>

<P>Well, to be honest, nobody knows. One potential clue is that the
perforant path of the hippocampus (a neural circuit) seems to release
endopsychosin when stimulated (<A HREF="refs.html#r138">138</A>).
Perhaps endopsychosin is a part of the memory process; or perhaps it
is involved in dreaming and the conversion of intermediate-term to
long-term memories. Another suggestion is that endopsychosin is
involved in long-term depression (LTD), the flip side of long-term
potentiation.</P>

<P>Another possibility is that endopsychosin is one of the brain's
natural defenses against injury. I find it interesting that
sigma/NMDA agents often mimic fever hallucinations; common
characteristics include Lilliputian hallucinations, geometrical and
linear hallucinations, and dysphoria. Perhaps the brain secretes
endopsychosins during high fever in an attempt to prevent
neurotoxicity.</P>

<P>In addition to potential neuroprotective roles, these substances
may have significant roles in regulating cognition and (in the body)
the immune and endocrine systems. A dysfunction of an endopsychosin,
or of the sigma receptors (or both) may be one of the causes of
schizophrenia. And if some steroids (e.g., progesterone and
testosterone) turn out to be endopsychosins, this could explain a lot
about the long-term behavioral effects of steroid use.</P>

<P>Or, it may simply be that altered states of consciousness are a
natural part of animal life, and that our culture's fear of such
states is abnormal. Certainly one doesn't need drugs to achieve
altered states; even profoundly dissociative states can be achieved
with a certain amount of ritual and faith. Most "primitive" cultures
have some experience with dissociative states such as astral
projection, shamanic journeying, possession, and that sort of thing.
They may very well know something that we don't.</P>

<P>Finally, the perceived effects of endopsychosins (and the drugs
that mimic them) may simply be side effects of something more
fundamental going on in the limbic system. Perhaps these alien and
spiritual encounters and other paranormal phenomena (see <A HREF="dxm_paranormal.html#toc.8">Section
8</A>) are the way that the conscious mind interprets limbic network
states that normally don't make it to consciousness.</P>

<P>So it is entirely possible that the similarity between NMDA
PCP<SUB>1</SUB> and sigma receptors has a purpose. In any case, data
about the effects of sigma-specific agonists (or antagonists for that
matter) are limited, but our understanding of these receptors should
improve in the next few years as research continues. Not to mention
the possibility of some brave and/or stupid psychonaut deciding to
experiment with sigma-specific agonists.</P>

<P>(+)-3-PPP and SKF-10,047 are good sigma-specific ligands; more
sigma<SUB>1</SUB> specific ligands include
1-phenylcycloalkanecarboxylic acid derivatives (<A HREF="refs.html#r122">122</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r127">127</A>)
Anyone feeling brave? Maybe you can become the next Shulgin
("Endopsychosins I Have Known And Loved" anyone?). Then again, maybe
you'd better not; I don't need to be sued if you develop a stubborn
case of insanity.</P>
