<H1><CENTER>3 &nbsp; DXM QuickFAQ</CENTER></H1>

<P><BR>
This is a quick question-and-answer section about DXM which avoids
most of the technical detail of the full FAQ sections. However, since
DXM is a complex drug, you are advised to read the appropriate
sections in the full FAQ.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.1 &nbsp; What is DXM?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
DXM, or dextromethorphan, is a cough suppressant drug found in cough
syrups and cough medicines. It can be used recreationally, but there
are risks.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.2 &nbsp; You Mean I Can Get High Off Cough
Syrup?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Yes, if you choose the right kind; if you pick the wrong kind, you
can end up dead. And you may not like the "high" you get; some people
love it, others hate it.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.3 &nbsp; What Kinds of Cough Medicine are
Safe?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Basically, anything containing <B>ONLY</B> dextromethorphan
hydrobromide (DXM HBr). Popular US brands include Robitussin Maximum
Strength Cough (and generic equivalents), Drixoral Cough Liquid Caps
(the red kind), and generic equivalents.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.4 &nbsp; What Happens if I Drink the Wrong Cough
Syrup?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
If it has gauifenesin (Robitussin DM and generic "DM" syrups have
this drug), you'll probably puke your guts up. If it has
acetaminophen (paracetamol), you stand a good chance of a painful,
prolonged death. Anything else, you're likely to ruin the trip and
may end up in the hospital.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.5 &nbsp; I'm Taking Other Drugs -- Can I Take
DXM?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Quick answer: it depends. Don't take DXM if you are taking any of the
following other drugs:<BR>
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Antidepressants of any kind. MAOIs (monoamine oxidase
   inhibitors) are the worst; DXM + a MAOI will kill you. DXM with
   other antidepressants can cause serotonin syndrome, an unpleasant
   and occasionally fatal condition.</LI>
   
   <LI>Diet drugs like phentermine, fenfluramine (Redux), or
   phen-fen. Again, a risk of serotonin syndrome.</LI>
   
   <LI>Non-drowsy antihistamines (allergy medicines) like Allegra,
   Seldane, or Hisminal.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><CENTER>3.6 &nbsp; What's the DXM Trip Like?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Well, that depends on how much you take. There are four different
kinds of experiences, based on the dosage; these are called
<I>plateaus</I>. The first plateau is a mild stimulant effect with a
little bit of a buzz, and has been compared to MDA. The second
plateau is more intoxicating and has been compared to being drunk and
stoned at the same time. The third plateau is dissociative, like a
lower dose of ketamine. The fourth plateau is fully dissociative like
a higher dose of ketamine.</P>

<P>You should <B>not</B> attempt higher plateau doses unless you have
someone with you who can take care of you in case you get sick or
freak out. It happens on DXM. Many things can happen unexpectedly on
upper plateaus, such as spontaneous memory recall, complex delusions,
hallucinations, out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, and
perceived contact with spiritual or alien entities. You need to be
pretty stable and grounded before you can handle these things.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.7 &nbsp; How Much DXM Do I Take?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
See the full FAQ; it's complicated and depends on your body weight;
furthermore, some people can't handle DXM due to a genetic mutation
in an important enzyme. So you <B>always</B> want to do a low dose on
your first trip, and then increase gradually with each new trip.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.8 &nbsp; Is DXM Like Acid?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
No. It's more like ketamine or PCP, but not much like them
either.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.9 &nbsp; Is DXM Fun?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Some people think so; others point out that while the lower two
dosage plateaus are more recreational or fun, the upper two seem to
be more suited for self-exploration and shamanic work.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.10 &nbsp; Is DXM Dangerous?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Yes, especially if you take too much. Some of the more important
dangers you might want to know about are:<BR>
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and allergic reactions (often from
   the cough syrup itself)</LI>
   
   <LI>Hot flashes, dizziness, and bad trips</LI>
   
   <LI>Psychotic breaks (generally from high dose use)</LI>
   
   <LI>Psychological addiction and depression (generally from regular
   use)</LI>
   
   <LI>Irreversible brain damage (from chronic use at high
   doses)</LI>
</UL>

<P>The last -- brain damage -- is fairly rare, occurring in less than
1% of the regular users I've interviewed. They all used DXM very
frequently. If you do DXM twice a month or less, you'll probably be
OK. But remember there's always the risk of something going
wrong.</P>

<H2><CENTER>3.11 &nbsp; If DXM is Dangerous, Why Do It?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
That's up to you. Most people in our culture seem to shun the idea of
taking real risks, whether it be through drugs or high-risk sports
such as mountain climbing and hang gliding. On the other hand, when
someone goes and climbs a mountain without adequate equipment and
training, and then falls to her death, nobody goes and blames the
mountain.</P>

<P>There are many people who believe that the risks of DXM (or other
drugs) are worth the rewards. If you are a legal adult and are
willing to take responsibility for your actions, in my opinion you
should be permitted to experiment with psychedelics to your heart's
content.</P>
