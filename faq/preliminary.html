<H3><CENTER>2.1.2 &nbsp; General Disclaimer</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
This text discusses some rather controversial topics. Currently,
there are laws in most places of the world that make it illegal to
use certain drugs for recreational purposes. It doesn't take a genius
to figure out that the <I>medical</I> nature of the drugs in question
has nothing to do with their legal status (otherwise, alcohol would
be illegal and we'd all be smoking dope). In particular, a lot of
people are making a lot of money from the illegal drug trade. The
distributors, manufacturers, and sellers of illegal drugs are among
them, of course. So are the law enforcement agencies and politicians,
and the manufacturers and distributors of legal drugs like nicotine
and alcohol. In the past few years, many scientists, physicians,
journalists, and others have suggested legalization as a way to
reduce the harm associated with the drug trade.</P>

<P>It is not my desire to address this topic in depth here. What is
important is that, in response to these suggestions, the proponents
of the War on Drugs (and its equivalents elsewhere) have become
increasingly aggressive. One of their goals is to prevent the
dissemination of information about recreational drugs (unless it's
their own propaganda). As such, anyone even discussing drug use is
walking on thin ice, and once you go about telling people how to do
it, the ice becomes a lot thinner.</P>

<P>I have no intention of being thrown into prison so that they are
forced to release rapists, murderers, and child molesters in order to
make room for me. I'm not planning to become a martyr any time soon;
I'd much prefer for the Drug Peace to come without violence (legal or
physical). However, I feel it is important to provide true
information about drugs. J. S. Mill argued very eloquently that if an
idea is true, then it can only become stronger when it is confronted
with falsehood; to prevent debate in the hope of protecting the
"truth" only leads to lies. I agree entirely, and quite frankly I
think anyone even thinking of getting into politics should be
familiar with (and hopefully agree with) Mill and his arguments.
Honest and open discussion of drugs can only lead to better policy
and less harm.</P>

<P>In any case, like so many others, I am walking on somewhat thin
ice here, and must take certain steps to protect myself. Thus the
following rather verbose disclaimer, which may or may not be worth
anything in an actual court of law:</P>

<P><STRONG>It is not my intention to influence anyone to commit an
illegal act. I explicitly instruct all readers not to violate any
international, national, state, regional, city, or other applicable
laws governing any of the information presented in any document

ass, or otherwise administer any legal or illegal drug (except for
legal drugs under order of a physician), or to engage in the
manufacture, distribution, synthesis, analysis, or other processing
of any legal or illegal drug, regardless of anything you may see in
the aforementioned documents. I advise everyone not to follow any
procedures listed. All information is presented for EDUCATIONAL
PURPOSES ONLY! </STRONG></P>

<P><B>Please</B> don't call me up, telling me I'm going to Hell or
somesuch nonsense. I don't believe in it and I don't have the time or
inclination to listen to that sort of drivel. Thus far I've gotten
very few negative responses, and I thank everyone who has taken the
time to email me, call me, or otherwise contact me.</P>

<P>Testimonials and personal data are presented anonymously. I do not
maintain copies of the sender's name, address, or personal
information, either online or offline, and thus I cannot give
information as to their identities. Any personal information,
testimonials, or reports as to DXM's effects that were or are sent to
me will be considered anecdotal and not specifically referring to the
sender. I encourage anyone with applicable data to send it to me
anonymously. Any data sent PGP encoded will be decoded on my private
system (MS-DOS) which is offline. After decoding, all information
regarding the sender's identity is overwritten (200 pass random
pattern). Thus I cannot link testimonials or information to senders
after this operation. Note that my system is NOT TEMPEST SECURE (not
that I've noticed any strange vans near my house).</P>

<H2><CENTER>2.2 &nbsp; Why a DXM FAQ?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>There is the philosophy among some in the USA (and probably the
rest of the world) that the best way to prevent people from making
mistakes is to withhold information from them. For example, this is
particularly noticeable in the case of sex education, where some
assert that teaching children about sex is equivalent to giving them
permission to copulate, and that, since no sex is perfectly safe, and
since teenagers especially have a tendency to take risks (e.g., no
birth control), we ought not to teach sex education in the schools.
One might just as easily say that teaching children about cars is
equivalent to giving them permission to drive, and that, since no
driving is perfectly safe, and since teenagers especially have a
tendency to take risks (e.g., racing down Main St.), we ought not to
teach driving education in schools.</P>

<P>This misguided philosophy of "ignorance is strength" is just as
often applied to information pertaining to drug use. In the case of
drug use, however, good information is immediately useful towards
preventing drug-related injuries. In the case of DXM, there are
several possible mistakes people can make, and the chance for making
a mistake is compounded by the fact that people hear "you can get
high off cough syrup" as advertisement for DXM use. At best they are
unprepared for the trip; at worst, they get hold of an
acetaminophen-containing preparation and end up in the hospital or
dead.</P>

<P>Make no mistake; this information will probably encourage some to
try, and continue to use, DXM. That is not my intention. A few of
these people may end up addicted, or at least habituated to the point
of trouble. That is certainly not my intention. My intention is to
make sure that everyone out there knows what the risks and effects of
DXM use are, so that s/he can make intelligent choices for herself or
himself. An intelligent choice is not always right, but it is fair,
and you always learn from it.</P>

<P>This text sprung out of the Usenet newsgroups <I>alt.drugs</I>and
<I>alt.psychoactives</I>, where about 1 or 2 questions a week about
DXM would appear. After responding weekly, or in some cases daily, I
decided to put together all the questions (and a few questions I
thought would follow) and write a full explanation of DXM. Some of
the material is fairly technical, but I thought it better to give too
much information than not enough. It is distributed once a month
(more or less) on the Usenet newsgroups
<I>rec.drugs.psychedelic</I>and <I>alt.drugs </I>(until the latter
disappears); please distribute it beyond Internet and Usenet (subject
to the restrictions above).</P>

<P>It is my sincere hope that this type of information may help the
Internet fulfill its potential as an information source. Those of us
who have the time and ability to provide good information should feel
obligated to do so; if we set a standard of high signal and low
noise, perhaps others will follow.</P>

<H2><CENTER>2.3 &nbsp; Keeping DXM Legal</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Right now, DXM is legal for over-the-counter use in most places.
This seems to be for two reasons primarily. First, there is no
substitute for DXM that does not also have abuse potential. Nor is
there likely to ever be one; everywhere the cough reflex can be
blocked involves some type of receptor associated with recreational
drug effects. Second, pharmaceutical companies don't want to lose a
major chunk of their income. DXM works as a cough suppressant, and it
works well. Besides, nobody wants to have to go to the doctor to get
a prescription every time they get a cold.</P>

<P>However, it is possible that DXM-only preparations might disappear
from the market. This would be unfortunate, both for recreational
users and for the general public; the most likely additive -
guaifenesin - makes some people vomit even at low doses. Another
possibility would be the addition of something which would be
harmless at regular doses but induce nausea (or other unpleasant
effects) at recreational doses.

<HR>

</P>

<P>The best answer is probably prevention, which unfortunately
involves two conflicting goals. On the one hand, it is essential that
DXM related deaths do not occur - this was my primary motivation in
making this FAQ in the first place. Several DXM cough medicines can
be dangerous if consumed recreationally, due to the presence of other
ingredients. There is also the problem of drug interactions, e.g.,
DXM + Seldane<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, which can be
fatal.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the spread of information to keep people from
hurting themselves is also likely to inform people who didn't know
about DXM, and will want to try it. DXM is still an unknown to many
people (although not as big an unknown as most think - pockets of
recreational DXM use have existed as long as DXM has). I've come to
the conclusion that I'd rather have a bunch of people doing it safely
than a few doing it dangerously - but then again, I'm also in favor
of sex education.</P>

<P>Thus, I encourage anyone who may want to try DXM or tell her or
his friends to try it (which I again explicitly tell you not to do)
to make sure and emphasize <EM>all</EM> the risks and dangers
involved. <EM>Don't</EM> rush into high dosages. <EM>Don't</EM> trip
alone, or without a designated sober person. <EM>Don't</EM> encourage
people who are not psychologically mature to experiment with DXM. And
<EM>please</EM> use common sense and be safe.</P>

<P>In the event that DXM-only preparations do get pulled, the best
answer is probably to have an isolation method that will separate the
DXM from other ingredients. In my opinion, the most likely additive
is guaifenesin (although people were using Robitussin
DM<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> long ago, and just toughing
out the inevitable extreme nausea). I've been working on a way to
separate the DXM from guaifenesin, using commonly available
substances, <EM>and producing a pure, safe product</EM>. We
<EM>don't</EM> want another "cat" (methcathinone) media-scare on our
hands. Currently I offer a method for evaluation only; <STRONG>this
method is not proven</STRONG>. I'm posting it with the FAQ so that
other people can give it their consideration.

<HR>

</P>

<P>In conclusion I'd like to remind everyone that we may be walking
on thin ice here. I've tried my absolute hardest to make this FAQ as
accurate and scholarly as possible, so that if anyone who matters
ever does get a look at it, they'll get bored somewhere around the
explanation of P450-2D6 polymorphism. Still, please use common
sense.</P>

<H2><CENTER>2.4 &nbsp; How to Use This Document</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>I have tried to make this document useful for a variety of
audiences, and as such it can sometimes get fairly technical. If
confused, consult the glossary; if still confused, check with a basic
neuropharmacology text. I unfortunately do not have the time to
answer general questions about neuropharmacology; I'm employed full
time at a small ISP, trying to finish my education, and married.</P>

<P>This document is broken up into chapters and sections by subject,
with appendices, references, glossary, and index. At present, figures
and diagrams are fairly minimal; I'm trying to improve that aspect.
Also, sometimes I simplify things a bit. If you take exception to
anything, email me with references and I'll consider modifying
it.</P>

<P>This document is distributed in three forms: ASCII text on Usenet;
HTML on the World Wide web (http://www.frognet.net/dxm), and in
printed form. I try to keep the HTML copy the most current, not an
easy task considering the length of the document. I still haven't
found an HTML editor that beats <I>vi</I>.</P>

<P>The following additional formats will be made available as I have
time to create them: Microsoft
Word<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>
PostScript<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> and PDF. Email me for
requests for any other format. Requests for oddball printer formats
will be redirected to the bit bucket. Again, apologies; I just don't
have much time anymore.</P>

<P>If this is coming to you via Usenet, please note that the Usenet
version is subdivided into sections; some news machines choke on very
long files. I <B>do not</B> post the section on what you can
synthesize from DXM, since it's mostly specialized information. Email
me if you want it. Otherwise, posting is once a month, with the DXM
Quick Reference being posted biweekly. If I'm eating up your
bandwidth, I'm sorry; recently a <B>lot</B> of DXM use has been going
on and I want to make sure everyone has the facts available.</P>
