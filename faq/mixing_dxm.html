<H1><CENTER>13 &nbsp; Mixing DXM and Other Drugs</CENTER></H1>

<P><BR>
Beware of mixing DXM and other drugs, legal or not. Any time you do,
you risk an adverse reaction with your own physiology that cannot be
predicted. Nonetheless, people have asked about it and here are the
results from people who have combined DXM and other drugs. In
addition to the sections below, you may wish to consult <A HREF="dxm_experiences.html#toc.14.4">Section
14.4</A> to see what people have written about their experiences with
DXM and other drugs.</P>

<H2><CENTER>13.1 &nbsp; Alcohol</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Some users report that a small amount of alcohol (a beer or two)
before the DXM can both enhance the trip and prevent some nausea.
Alcohol following the DXM trip seems to be reduced in some, but not
all, of its effects. Note that large doses of alcohol combined with
DXM often cause prolonged vomiting (up to 2 hours!) Alcohol after the
end of a high dosage DXM trip has been reported to temporarily bring
back many of the dissociative effects (cannabis and nitrous oxide
also do this). This seems possible up to five days after the DXM
trip, depending on your metabolism and brain chemistry.</P>

<H2><CENTER>13.2 &nbsp; Barbiturates and
Benzodiazepines</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Barbiturates ("downers") include drugs like seconal and nembutal;
benzodiazepines include drugs like diazepam
(Valium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>),
Librium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, and other antianxiety
drugs. Generally speaking most but not all prescribed sedatives,
antianxiety drugs, and recreational "downers" fall into this
category.</P>

<P>Some people have reported that combining DXM with a <B>low</B>
dose of a benzodiazepine can prevent some of the more annoying side
effects (mostly related to overstimulation, high blood pressure, and
tachycardia). Clonazepam (Clonopin&#91;tm&#93;) in particular has
been reported to have specific effects in combination with DXM,
different from other benzodiazepines. These effects include enhanced
CEV's (closed-eye visuals) and, of course, limiting or preventing
sympathomimetic effects (high blood pressure and heart rate,
sweating, etc.). I can't recommend this, and these drugs are of
course prescription-only, but it doesn't seem to me that a <B>low</B>
dose would be harmful. Just don't do it regularly.</P>

<P>I <B>strongly</B> suggest you avoid barbiturates, and be careful
with benzodiazpeines; both barbiturates and benzodiazepines tend to
be dangerous enough by themselves and are frequently fatal when
combined with other depressants (such as alcohol).</P>

<H2><CENTER>13.3 &nbsp; Amphetamines and Other
Psychostimulants</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
This is probably asking for high blood pressure problems, strokes,
brain hemorrhages, and the like. While a few people enjoy this
combination, most find it unpleasantly speedy anyway. Most who've
tried it reported that DXM will potentiate other stimulants. Since
DXM inhibits dopamine reuptake, combining it with a dopamine
releasing agent (amphetamine or methamphetamine) will naturally
produce a combined, synergistic effect. I'd suggesting avoiding this
at all costs.</P>

<P>Combining DXM, a psychostimulant, and a monoamine oxidase
inhibitor is a sure way to make your blood pressure skyrocket and
will probably kill you (if you're lucky) or leave you with severe
brain damage (if you aren't lucky).</P>

<H2><CENTER>13.4 &nbsp; Cannabis (Marijuana)</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
DXM and cannabis is a frequent combination, which most people seem to
enjoy, at least at lower doses of DXM. High doses of DXM (third
plateau and up) mixed with cannabis can be <I>very, very
dissociative</I> and sometimes unpleasant. A few people have reported
that cannabis with DXM makes them feel very stupid.</P>

<P>One user reported that 360mg DXM followed 3.5h later by "a bowl or
two" produced a very profound, and unique, intoxication. Severe
flanging of all sensory input was present, and there was an overall
"vibration" feeling present in the muscles. With eyes closed, he
could think fairly clearly, and solve simple and complex tasks much
easier than on DXM or cannabis alone; however, with eyes open (or
other sensory distraction) cognitive abilities deteriorated rapidly.
Motor skills were possible only when performed automatically; any
attempt to focus on them led to difficulties.</P>

<P>Several users have reported that cannabis and DXM generally "go
well" together. Note that cannabis after the DXM trip is over seems
to bring back some of the dissociative effects, much like alcohol and
nitrous oxide.</P>

<P>DXM probably interacts with marijuana at a pharmacological level.
Dissociatives decrease the analgesic response to THC (<A HREF="refs.html#r214">214</A>)
and downregulate THC receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r218">218</A>).</P>

<H2><CENTER>13.5 &nbsp; LSD, Psilocybin (Shrooms), and Other 5HT
Hallucinogens</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
I've received a limited number (about 20) of reports of mixing DXM
with 5HT hallucinogens, primarily LSD and mushrooms. While one person
said this combination was "not recommended", most have had incredibly
profound experiences. On the other hand, very few of these have said
they would ever repeat the combination, as it was simply far too
powerful and terrifying. One person told me that DXM helped him avoid
unpleasant cognitive effects and "bad trips" he might otherwise get
from LSD alone. Regular use of DXM may alter the effects of LSD due
to overall increase in 5HT binding (<A HREF="refs.html#r252">252</A>)
and decreased 5HT<SUB>2</SUB> receptor binding (<A HREF="refs.html#r212">212</A>).</P>

<P>A good description of the DXM + LSD experience was provided by one
person:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Anyways that day I had been up about 18 hours when I took
   the lsd. After doing some fingerpainting and noticing how the
   visuals were pretty good for only 1 hit and just having recently
   tripped I decided to give the dxm another whirl. So I took
   300mg.<BR>
   At first I felt slightly out of it a bit drunk. As I sat in the
   chair however I began to feel like I was sinking deep within
   myself. It became very hard to focus on anything so I closed my
   eyes. Whew-wee what a mistake. The visuals were *intense* blinding
   lights, zooming, it was unlike anything I had ever seen. I opened
   my eyes and when they couldnt focus I began to feel horribly sick.
   So I went and threw up it lasted about 30 seconds and after I
   threw up (instantly) I began to feel incredibly fucked up. I was
   very depersonalized. I felt like I was nothing more than a dot
   inside my head. Focus on anything was next to impossible and my
   eyes began to shift a lot. The vertigo was immense if I looked at
   any repeating pattern. Enigma was playing on the stereo and it
   sounded so full and deep it was hard to listen to. I layed down
   and closed my eyes and began another rushing trip. This one was
   much more intenst than the first so intense that my brain began to
   feel very overloaded. I suddeny had to throw up again becase of
   the *music*; it was just too much to handle. At this point I felt
   incredibly horrible. My head felt like it was pulsating, as did my
   whole body. It was as though I was showering the room with excess
   energy. The music was turned off and I gained some composure. This
   time after thorwing up (just water) I felt wonderful. I relaxed
   and layed down again and then it began. The most wonderous
   experience of my life. There just are no words to describe the
   nenxt 4 or 5 hours. I would close my eyes and the visuals were so
   lifelike. It was like a waking dream where I had full control.
   Soemtimes it was hard to tell if my eyes were close or open. When
   they were open I was having mass hallucinations. Walls with
   paintings that werent there etc... It was just incredible...to sum
   up the pros and cons.<BR>
   Dont do lsd+dxm if your not VERY stable. The possibility of a bad
   trip is easily much higher than the possibilty of a good one. Dont
   do dxm+lsd if you've ever had a bad trip due to repressed
   memories. Dont do dxm+lsd if your afraid of seeing wierd shit when
   you puke (if you puke on dxm) this I see as being extremely
   tramatic for a number of people. Dont do dxm+lsd if your worried
   about it. You will at time prolly feel like you are dying/or dead
   (the upside is you feel so content you dont really care).<BR>
   Do dxm+lsd if you can take it and want the trip of your life.
   Quite simply I have never seen anything else that even came close
   to comparing.<BR>
   Will I do it again? I doubt it. I achieved what I was looking for
   in the whole trip thing; complete and total fooling of my
   mind.<BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.13.6"></A></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>13.6 &nbsp; Opiates</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
One person says that small amounts of opiates tend to "mellow out"
the DXM trip, and reduce the possibility for panic attacks or
anxiety. Another user said opiates should only be taken after the
peak of the DXM trip, because otherwise they would cancel each other
out to some degree.</P>

<P>On the other hand, this may be a dangerous combination, and I'd
recommend against it. Both DXM and opiates can depress respiration
and high enough doses, and there might be a synergistic effect.</P>

<P>Recently, a new product has appeared on the streets containing
heroin, scopolamine, dextromethorphan, cocaine, and thiamine. Called
"Homicide" or "Super Buick", it presents extraordinary problems due
to its high toxicity. Even worse, when naloxone is given for
overdose, the toxicity of the other drugs can become apparent
(<A HREF="refs.html#r371">371-372</A>).</P>

<H2><CENTER>13.7 &nbsp; PCP and Ketamine</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The few reports I have received have indicated that ketamine plus DXM
was not much different from ketamine. One person said that a small
dose of ketamine can boost the DXM experience by one plateau. I
expect that most of DXM's particular effects on sigma receptors are
overshadowed by ketamine's NMDA antagonism. Ketamine is a much more
potent NMDA antagonist than DXM, and since they both compete for the
same site, DXM isn't going to affect this much.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.13.8"></A></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>13.8 &nbsp; Nicotine</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
This is a combination I hadn't considered before, but which evidently
is fairly interesting. Nicotine seems to vastly potentiate DXM's
effects for some people, enough so that one user reported that one
cigarette could floor him on a second plateau trip. Another user
reported that nicotine helped him overcome some of the memory
problems with higher doses of DXM, but tended to induce nausea.</P>

<P>On the other hand, several people have told me that DXM should be
avoided if one smokes cigarettes regularly (even if you don't smoke
during the trip), because of nausea, hot flashes, and other
unpleasant interactions. This might be due to inhibition of MAO by
cigarettes (<A HREF="refs.html#r378">378</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r379">379</A>)
and if so, cigarettes should be avoided.</P>

<H2><CENTER>13.9 &nbsp; Phenethylamines (MDMA, MDA, 2CB,
etc)</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
I have very limited data on mixing these drugs with DXM. One person
mixed DXM and 2CB ("bees") and had a wonderful experience:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Ever since I first read D.M. Turner's excellent
   <I>Essential Psychedelic Guide</I> and saw his glowing reports on
   the combination of Ketamine and bees, I have had quite a hankering
   to try an entheogenic cocktail of that variety. Bees have been
   plentiful lately, but Ketamine is as hard as ever to come by for
   me. Recently I had an interesting idea - since DXM is relatively
   close chemically and experientially to K, as well as being cheap,
   legal, and easy to acquire, why not use it as a substitute in the
   combo?
   
   <P>So the other night I took 300 mgs. of DXM in the form of
   Drixoral Cough Liquid Caps, a preparation that contains no other
   unwanted active ingredients like acetaminophen, guafinesen, or
   pseudoephedrine and has the added advantge of being low on sugars
   and syrups that can cause gatsric distress in large doses. This
   dose of DXM alone would not be sufficient to evoke a fully
   dissociative episode for me, but I decided to err on the side of
   caution as I usually do when trying a new mix. After an hour or
   so, I began to feel the euphoria that is my first alert with this
   particular material and took 20 mgs of bees. I was chatting on IRC
   at the time and within twenty minutes typing became much too
   complicated to deal with, so I lay down and relaxed into the
   trip.</P>
   
   <P>There were some uncomfortable somatic symptoms at first, such
   as a feeling of physical heaviness similar to that induced by
   alcohol, minor stomach upset, and hot flashes (which had me a
   little worried until I took my temperature and found it to be
   normal.) Fortunately, these passed quickly as my consciousness
   dissociated from my body. I began to feel as if my soul was a
   soaring kite that was connected to my physical form by only the
   thinnest etheral guide rope. Then my physical awareness seemingly
   vanished, and I found myself in a state that was nearly identical
   to the experience of Ketamine that I had on the two occasions I
   was lucky enough to acquire some. I felt that I reverted back to
   the ground of being, the original undifferentiated oneness, the
   primal monad. Everything was perfect, all was one, and it was me.
   Then something fantastic happened. I felt as though I was given an
   opportunity to experience the original creation process that
   produced the material universe. I saw/felt/percieved the monad
   make love to itself and give birth to what we know as the manifest
   cosmos. I <B>was</B> the monad making love and giving birth, and
   it felt incredible, like multiple orgasms of universal
   proportions. This was a very meaningful episode for me, because it
   seemed to afford a pointed insight into one of the main
   philosophical questions I've been thinking about for quite some
   time. The question was: why did the monad split in the first
   place? Why disturb that original pristine oneness at all? As I
   shivered and shook with the pleasure of the birthing process, the
   answer seemed very clear: simply for the joy of the <B>doing</B>,
   not because of any kind of expected result. The universe is a work
   in progress, not a finished product, and it is the <B>process</B>
   of creation that is most important.</P>
   
   <P>That episode lasted maybe half an hour or so, and then I began
   to gradually regain my physical consciousness. I spent the rest of
   the trip in a lovely state that I can only describe in terms of
   post-coital glow on a cosmic scale accompanied by the lovely
   visuals that are characteristic of the bees. Near the end of the
   experience, I had the opportunity to smoke some salvia, and had
   the feeling of communing with the spirit of the plant. It felt
   great; very warm and comforting. Ska Maria definitely likes the
   bees, and she seems to like me too! I slept about four hours and
   awoke the next morning feeling reborn and refreshed, enjoying a
   quite delightful afterglow that lasted the entire day. I reccomend
   the combination of bees and dissociatives highly, and will most
   definitely be doing further exploration along these lines in the
   future when the opportunity presents itself.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><CENTER>13.10 &nbsp; Nootropics (Smart Drugs)</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
A few regular users of dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), around 800mg per
day, have reported that the regular use of DMAE prevents a lot of the
memory and cognitive problems associated with DXM use, while still
leaving the rest of its interesting effects. One user also reported
that lecithin prevented some of the confusion associated with
DXM.</P>

<P>A similar effect has been reported for piracetam. See also

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Several people have reported to me that nitrous oxide goes well
with DXM, especially towards the end of the trip. This seems to be
consistent with nitrous oxide's effects in combination with other
hallucinogens. Specifically, nitrous oxide seems to intensely
multiply the flanging, "stoning", and dissociative effects without
added adverse side effects.</P>

<P><B>Do not under any circumstances use DXM with yohimbine or any
other alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist</B>. This combination could
vastly potentiate the danger of Olney's lesions (see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.3.1">Section
6.3.1</A>).</P>

<P>It might be a good idea to avoid tetrodotoxin, given DXM's sodium
channel blocking ability. (This is a joke! No, don't go out and try
zombie potion).</P>
