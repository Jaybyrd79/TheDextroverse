<H1><CENTER>11 &nbsp; DXM Chemistry and Extraction</CENTER></H1>

<P><BR>
This section has been completely rewritten, as new information has
been received about acid-base extraction and about extraction of
DXM+guaifenesin preparations. The "Agent Lemon" process has also been
added.</P>

<P>Please remember to always wear safety goggles when working with
chemicals, and be generally careful with these procedures. My thanks
to all who did research on this subject.</P>

<H2><CENTER>11.1 &nbsp; How Can I Extract DXM From Cough Syrups and
Gelcaps?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
I'm going to present this as "kitchen chemistry" as I feel most
people with adequate chemistry knowledge (and equipment) will be able
to do it correctly without my help.</P>

<P>There are three procedures for DXM extraction that are commonly
used: precipitation and filtration, single-phase acid-base
extraction, and dual-phase acid-bsae extraction (the "Agent Lemon"
process). The first method is by far the least popular because the
DXM precipitate is often so fine that it passes through the filter
paper.</P>

<P>You can, of course, still use the precipitation procedure; I just
don't recommend it. If you do choose to precipitate DXM, try to get
actual filter paper rather than a coffee filter - it will help.</P>

<H3><CENTER>11.1.1 &nbsp; Theory of Acid-Base
Extractions</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The acid-base extraction process is a common method for isolating a
desired chemical from undesirable "gunk". The theory is that certain
chemicals (generally, alkaloids) occur in two forms: a water-soluble
complex with an acid, and an oil-soluble free base form. For example,
pseudoephedrine (Sudafed<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>), a
decongestant, is usually supplied as the hydrochloride salt
(pseudoephedrine HCl). It can also exist as a base, without an acid
molecule (thus the term "free base"). You can convert an alkaloid
from acid salt to free base (or vice versa) using a base (or
acid).</P>

<P>The practical upshot is you take your chemical and "gunk", and
raise the pH with a base (e.g., sodium hydroxide) until the chemical
converts to free base form and precipitates out (since it's no longer
soluble in water). Now you add a nonpolar solvent (an "oily" layer)
for the chemical to dissolve in, shake for a long time, and all the
chemical you want is in the nonpolar layer. Discard the polar (i.e.,
water) layer, and you're left with a nonpolar layer full of your
chemical .....</P>

<P>Plus anything else that might be oil-soluble. So you reverse the
process, by adding an acid until the free base turns into an acid
salt, and precipitates out of the nonpolar layer. Add water, shake,
and you can discard your nonpolar layer.</P>

<P>This is the acid-base extraction, and it's very frequently used to
extract the active ingredients from plants (free clue: the THC in
marijuana is <I>not</I> an alkaloid and thus won't extract this
way).</P>

<H3><CENTER>11.1.2 &nbsp; Single-Phase Acid-Base Extraction of
DXM</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
So how do we apply this to DXM? Well, it turns out that DXM is an
alkaloid, and you can extract DXM from cough syrups using the same
process. Furthermore, this procedure even works for DXM plus
guaifenesin syrups, e.g., <I>Robitussin DM</I>, and generic
equivalents (invariably called <I>Tussin DM</I>). The "DM" syrups
usually only contain 10mg/5ml of DXM, so you won't get as much yield,
but they're usually cheaper (and more commonly available).</P>

<P>This is actually a single-phase acid-base extraction, because we
only go from acid form (DXM HBr) to base form (DXM free base). The
final product ends up dissolved in an organic solvent, which is then
evaporated to leave DXM free base.</P>

<P>I have added a new set of steps to this process to help to remove
some of the gunk that can end up in the final product. These steps
are in italics and may be omitted if desired.</P>

<P><B>Do NOT try this extraction procedure with cough syrups or
formulations containing acetaminophen/paracetamol, pseudoephedrine,
other decongestants, or antihistamines</B>. Decongestants and
antihistamines are usually alkaloids and will end up in the final
product; as for acetaminophen, I'm not convinced yet of the safety of
the final product.</P>

<P>For this procedure you will need:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Cough syrup (obviously) or some other DXM-containing
   preparation. The <B>only</B> active ingredients that should be
   listed are <I>dextromethorphan </I>and <I>guaifenesin</I>. Avoid
   alcohol (check the inactive ingredients). If you can get DXM-only
   preparations, do so; the DXM+guaifenesin preparations tend to
   contain less DXM than the DXM-only ones.</LI>
   
   <LI>Two plastic two-liter bottles, washed and with the label
   removed. Of course, you can use flasks if you have them.</LI>
   
   <LI>A glass container to make your sodium hydroxide solution in (a
   mason jar works; you can also use a drinking glass).</LI>
   
   <LI>Two plastic bags with a slide-lock closure (e.g.,
   Ziploc<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>), big enough to hold
   the cough syrup plus an additional amount of lighter fluid. The
   plastic bags should be non-pleated. They will be used as
   separatory funnels.</LI>
   
   <LI>A nonpolar solvent. The easiest to get is
   Zippo<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> lighter fluid (or an
   equivalent) - note that this is <I>cigarette lighter</I> fluid,
   not charcoal lighter fluid. You want your solvent to evaporate
   quickly, leaving no residue. The easiest way to test it is by
   placing a drop or two onto a pocket mirror, and letting it
   evaporate; if it leaves no residue or smell, you can use it.</LI>
   
   <LI>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Photography supply stores carry this.
   In a pinch, some people have been known to use Red
   Devil<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> Lye. <B>I do not advise
   this!</B> Lye is likely to be impure. If you must use lye, make
   sure you let your sodium hydroxide solution settle (see below).
   Note that sodium hydroxide is caustic and severely damaging to the
   eyes, so wear your safety goggles!</LI>
   
   <LI>A heat-resistant glass baking dish (smaller is better).</LI>
   
   <LI>Distilled water (tap water won't work as well due to the
   chlorine and dissolved ions).</LI>
   
   <LI>A pair of scissors</LI>
   
   <LI>Access to the outdoors.</LI>
</UL>

<P>To speed up the process (from overnight to about 30 minutes), you
will have to evaporate the solvent with heating. For this you will
require:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>An electric wok or skillet, or a hot plate with a pot of water
   on it. Basically, you want a flameless (electric) source of heat
   that will heat up a volume of water, which you can put your baking
   dish in (the hot water will heat the baking dish).</LI>
   
   <LI>A hair dryer</LI>
   
   <LI>An <B>OSHA-certified</B> organic vapor mask</LI>
</UL>

<P>Some warnings about organic vapors. The solvents you will in all
likelihood be dealing with (hexane, heptane, petroleum ether,
whatever) are bad for you. <B>Really</B> bad for you -- they can give
you brain damage if you inhale too much of them. You do <B>NOT</B>
want to breathe the fumes. Get it? So, if you want to speed up the
process, pony up US$30.00 or so for an OSHA certified organic vapor
gas mask (tell `em you'll be painting with oil-based paint). Sure,
it's uncomfortable and looks dorky. But it sure beats brain damage!
Additionally, you <B>absolutely must</B>do the evaporation outdoors
(unless you happen to have a fume cabinet handy. And <B>NO</B>, the
stove or bathroom fan does <B>NOT</B> count as a fume cabinet).</P>

<P>A brief word or two about sodium hydroxide: it's caustic,
especially to the eyes, and when you add it to water it will heat up.
Always add the sodium hydroxide to the water, and not vice versa. If
you get it on your skin, wash it off with water (it won't eat through
your hand unless you let it sit there).</P>

<P>If you can't find sodium hydroxide at your local photo store, go
get a photography magazine and look in the back for mail order
suppliers. Many of them carry sodium hydroxide. It is a very common
chemical and ordering it isn't going to bring the DEA knocking down
your door. Please try to avoid using lye. If you still can't get
sodium hydroxide, use the Agent Lemon process.</P>

<P>Okay, here we go:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Form a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) by placing one
   tablespoon (15ml) of solid sodium hydroxide in one cup (about
   236ml) of distilled water in the sodium hydroxide solution
   container. Stir until dissolved. If you are using lye (I don't
   recommend it), wait awhile to let any impurities settle out to the
   bottom. Note that dissolving the NaOH will generate some
   heat.</LI>
   
   <LI>Empty your cough syrup or formula into the two-liter, rinsing
   the last of the cough syrup out of the syrup bottles with
   distilled water. If using gelcaps, break them open and rinse out
   the inside of the capsules.</LI>
   
   <LI><I>The following steps in italics are suggested for removing
   some of the gunk that can make it through the extraction and leave
   you with a sticky residue instead of crystalline DXM.<BR>
   Add in enough lighter fluid to the two-liter bottle to make a
   roughly 1/4 inch (or roughly 5mm) deep layer of lighter fluid per
   4oz of syrup.</I></LI>
   
   <LI><I>Cap the two-liter bottle and shake the living hell out of
   it for at least five minutes. Let it sit undisturbed until the two
   layers separate again.</I></LI>
   
   <LI><I>Pour the entire contents of the two-liter bottle into a
   sealable plastic baggie, and seal it shut. Hold it by one of the
   top corners so that a bottom corner is facing down. Let the layers
   separate again if necessary.</I></LI>
   
   <LI><I>Holding the baggie's corner over a CLEAN two-liter bottle,
   snip off the very tip of the corner. Let the cough syrup layer
   drain into the clean two-liter bottle, but pinch it shut right
   before any of the lighter fluid drains out.</I></LI>
   
   <LI><I>Discard the lighter fluid by placing it into an empty
   container and letting it evaporate outdoors. Do not put it down
   the drain or set it on fire.<BR>
   That's it ... now you should have cough syrup that has had a great
   deal of the flavorings and other gunk removed from it. You can
   repeat the italicized steps if you want to remove even
   more.</I></LI>
   
   <LI>Add one tablespoon (15ml) of sodium hydroxide solution to the
   two-liter bottle. You should see a rapid formation of a milky
   precipitate. Swirl the bottle gently to mix the syrup evenly, and
   the precipitate should redissolve (because there's not enough base
   yet).</LI>
   
   <LI>Repeat the above step, until the precipitate <I>doesn't</I>
   redissolve with swirling. The entire solution should be cloudy
   (stir well to make sure the base is evenly distributed).</LI>
   
   <LI>Add one more tablespoon (15ml) of sodium hydroxide solution to
   the bottle.</LI>
   
   <LI>Add enough lighter fluid to make a 1/8" (0.3mm) deep layer per
   4oz bottle of syrup.</LI>
   
   <LI>Cap the bottle, shake the hell out of it for five minutes, and
   let it stand until the layers separate again. If the layers don't
   want to separate, try adding table salt.</LI>
   
   <LI>Carefully pour the contents of the bottle into the sealable
   plastic bag, and close it shut ("yellow and blue make green-it's
   sealed!"). Hold the bag by one of the top corners so that one of
   the bottom corners points down.</LI>
   
   <LI>Let the two layers separate again (this should only take a few
   seconds).</LI>
   
   <LI>Cut off the tip of the bottom corner and allow the water layer
   (the bottom layer) to drain out of the bag. When the water layer
   has drained out, pinch the bag shut.</LI>
   
   <LI>Hold the bag over the baking dish, and allow the nonpolar
   solvent layer to drain out into the baking dish.</LI>
   
   <LI>Take the baking dish outdoors. At this point, if you don't
   have a gas mask and a way to heat the baking dish, you'll have to
   let the solvent evaporate (which may take a day or so), so skip
   the next 4 steps.</LI>
   
   <LI>Put on your gas mask and take the baking dish, hair dryer, and
   electric heat source outdoors.</LI>
   
   <LI>Place the baking dish into the container of water (electric
   wok, electric skillet, hot plate with pan of water, whatever), and
   set it to simmer. If you can't set the temperature low enough,
   you'll have to turn the heater on and off manually to maintain a
   near-boiling temperature.</LI>
   
   <LI>Plug in the hair dryer and <I>gently</I> blow hot air into the
   baking dish. Take care not to splash solvent over the sides of the
   dish. Incidentally, make sure you don't overload your circuit; it
   might be a good idea to alternate heating with the hot
   plate/wok/skillet and heating with the hair dryer.</LI>
   
   <LI>Continue heating until all the solvent evaporates. At this
   point you may see a thin layer of crystalline material; you might
   see a shiny layer of goo that looks a lot like the glass itself
   (which can be confusing); or you might see a layer of brown gunk.
   Whatever. Anyway, make sure all the solvent has evaporated.</LI>
   
   <LI>If your baking dish is covered with an oily substance (goo,
   gunk, whatever), you in all likelihood managed to extract some
   propylene glycol (or something else) along with the DXM. Blow hot
   air from the hair dryer onto the surface of the dish until the
   material dries completely (this may take 5 to 10 minutes). This
   should evaporate the propylene glycol, leaving behind only
   DXM.</LI>
   
   <LI>Scrape the DXM off the baking dish with a razor blade or other
   convenient sharp edge. You now have DXM free base.</LI>
</OL>

<P>A few comments. First, guaifenesin seems to itself convert to an
oily layer if you add too much sodium hydroxide, so don't overdo it.
Second, if you happen to have lab equipment you can of course use a
separatory funnel (which is what the plastic baggie is for). Third,
if you don't think you got anything, make sure the baking dish is
completely dry; sometimes the DXM free base plus propylene glycol can
look a lot like the glass itself.</P>

<H3><CENTER>11.1.3 &nbsp; Agent Lemon: Dual-Phase Acid-Base
Extraction of DXM</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The Agent Lemon process is a newer and in all honesty a much better
method for extracting DXM. It takes less time, doesn't involve
playing with flammable and toxic fumes, and doesn't require sodium
hydroxide. Here is the Agent Lemon method as posted on Usenet. I have
inserted a few comments in italics, primarily with regards to
separating the organic and water phases. They use a siphon tube, but
I believe that the Zip-Lock<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> bag
separatory funnel is a better idea.</P>

<CENTER>OPERATION AGENT LEMON<BR>

Reverend Anastasia Albert</CENTER>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>After establishing control over 80% of the world's Drixoral
supply, our troop was in a position to change the face of DXMology
forever, in the interest of accelerating human transcension.</P>

<P><B>The Mission:</B> extract DXM from cough syrups with materials
and equipment that one could buy without any trouble at your nearest
Woolworth's.</P>

<P><B>Theory:</B></P>

<P>The DXM FAQ &#91;1&#93; describes an acid-base extraction method
that requires materials (specifically Sodium Hydroxide) that are
difficult to get in pure form for many people. Read it for the
theory. Now, after you read it, we'll add on the following:</P>

<P>The "acid-base" extraction in the FAQ does not actually use an
acid stage. We can add an acid stage, to remove the DXM from the
solvent. Therefore, we can avoid the need to evaporate a lot of
solvent -- we can just throw it out the drain. Thus, you can do this
without producing vapors that will lead your neighbors to think you
are running a meth lab.</P>

<P><B>The Materials:</B> (this will blow you away)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>DXM-containing cough syrup. This process will probably produce
   a dangerous product if you use a syrup that contains any active
   ingredients other than DXM or Guaifenesin. DON'T! We used Robo Max
   Cough because CVS was closed.</LI>
   
   <LI>Ordinary Household ammmonia (clear, not lemon or some other
   scent)</LI>
   
   <LI>Lighter Fluid (we used "Zippo"; check criteria in FAQ
   &#91;1&#93;). Make sure it evaporates with no residue.</LI>
   
   <LI>Citric Acid. Available as a canning supply at your
   neighborhood supermarket. We used lemon juice on the first
   attempt, but we switched to citric acid after consultations
   (&#91;1&#93;, personal communication).</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Equipment:</B></P>

<P><I>A brief interjection here. This paper suggests using a siphon
to separate the layers. However, I think the plastic baggie
separatory funnel is a superior method, for two reasons. First,
rubber tubing (and many types of plastic) are attacked by organic
solvents, and can degenerate, or (worse) dissolve into the solvent
and possibly muck up the extraction. Second, you get much better
control with a separatory funnel, even a kitchen chemistry version. I
will follow up their method with my suggestion.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Some containers and flexible rubber tubing to use as a siphon.
   We cut ours off our vaporizer because we don't know where we
   stashed the tubing.</LI>
   
   <LI><I>Two large zipper-seal (e.g.,
   Zip-Lock</I><FONT SIZE="-2"><I><SUP>TM</SUP></I></FONT><I>)
   plastic freezer bags, unpleated (if you want to use the separatory
   funnel concept instead of the siphon).</I></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Concept:</B></P>

<P>Prepare ahead of time a solution of the citric acid in water. For
two bottles of tussin (8 oz each) we used 3 tablespoons of citric
acid in 8 fluid ounces of water.</P>

<P>Add ammonia to DXM. DXM converts from hydrobromide salt to
freebase and precipitates out of water. Since it is now nonpolar it
wants to go into a non polar solvent. Now you add a nonpolar solvent
and shake hard. Free base goes into solution in solvent. Let solvent
float to the top. (doesn't mix with water) Physically separate the
layers. Now the DXM is in the nonpolar layer, mix that with the acid
and shake well. The DXM converts back into the acid salt (since lemon
juice has citric acid in it, we make DXM hydrocitrate). This is so
beautiful because the DXM is practically pulled across the oil-water
interface by the hydrogen ion gradient.</P>

<P>Now you throw out the oil layer, and the DXM is now acid salt in
the lemon juice. Boil it for a few minutes in the microwave, stir it
good, so any volatile solvent that remains will evaporate.</P>

<P>You are left with "Agent Lemon" or "DXemon juice", a highly
concentrated product, which is superior to cough syrup -- if you
really wanted to, you could probably boil away the water -- with no
danger, since the amount of solvent is almost nothing, and get a
crystalline product that might be cut with anhydrous citric acid.
<I>I wouldn't suggest it, since it might irritate the
stomach.</I></P>

<P><B>Details:</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Put cough syrup in 2 liter bottle.</LI>
   
   <LI>Pour in a lot of ammonia. Excess is not a serious problem. The
   ammonia volume was about equal to the syrup volume.</LI>
   
   <LI>Stir.</LI>
   
   <LI>Pour into a tightly sealable vessel. A funnel is good to
   have.<BR>
   <I>Incidentally, you can probably just use the same 2-liter bottle
   and pour the lighter fluid into that; the plastic won't
   dissolve.</I></LI>
   
   <LI>Add about a 1/2 inch thick layer of lighter fluid.</LI>
   
   <LI>Shake the hell out of the vessel. We did it for about five
   minutes.</LI>
   
   <LI>Pour the liquid back into 2 liter.</LI>
   
   <LI>Let the organic solvent layer separate, it wil float on top of
   the water.</LI>
   
   <LI>We used a siphon to separate the layers. We filled the siphon
   (a flexible rubber tube) with water, and while covering one end,
   plunged the siphon deep into the water layer.
   
   <P>Hold the free end of the siphon below the other end of the
   siphon, and let go of the end. Let the liquid drain into a jar.
   Throw out the watery layer.</P>
   
   <P><I>The other way to separate the layers is with a separatory
   funnel, or the approximate version (a plastic bag). Pour the
   entire contents of the bottle into the sealable plastic bag, seal
   it, let the layers separate, clip off the bottom corner, and let
   the watery layer (on the bottom) drain out into the drain. Then
   let the organic layer drain into the jar.</I></P></LI>
   
   <LI>If you want to minimize the amount of water-ammonia-cough
   syrup inactive ingredients, add more water, let separate and
   siphon <I>(or separate)</I> again. We were paranoid and did this
   four times. The product we got towards the end didn't even taste
   like ammonia.</LI>
   
   <LI>Now mix the solvent layer with the citric acid solution.</LI>
   
   <LI>Transfer to snapple jar.</LI>
   
   <LI>Really shake the hell out of it. We shook it for 5 minutes,
   splitting the work between the three of us.</LI>
   
   <LI>It takes a few minutes to separate. Wait.
   
   <P><I>Some have reported a soapy layer forms in between the two
   layers; if so, just let it sit until the soapy layer is completely
   gone (it may take a few hours).</I></P></LI>
   
   <LI>Next stage. Use the siphon again, we recommend being
   conservative and not letting any solvent get into the siphon at
   all, so we left a little water layer.
   
   <P><I>Or use a new plastic storage bag, and this time keep the
   water layer and discard the organic layer. Be friendly to the
   environment and let it evaporate outside; don't just pour it down
   the drain.</I></P></LI>
   
   <LI>Boil the lemon juice for a few minutes (we did for seven), the
   theory is that if a little bit of the organic solvent is there, it
   will boil away.</LI>
   
   <LI>Drink the Agent Lemon. We have not deterimined the best
   method, we think you could mix it with something, or maybe drink
   it straight. It tastes really bitter (that's the DXM).</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Results:</B></P>

<P>(Note: This was a previous trial with 4 oz. of syrup and with
lemon juice instead of citric acid. This may give an inferior
product.) One of us (I.R.) volunteered to assay the material
extracted. Since I am a 105 kg. male in good health (except for the
tail end of a nagging cold) I was considered to be the best subject.
I thinned the material from about 1 fl. oz. to about 8 fl. oz. and
added six tablespoons of sugar. I consumed the material at
approximately 4:20 in the afternoon. The extracted product seemed to
have a washed-out lemon taste (some flavor oil probably went into the
organic phase). There was a bitter taste which I believe is DXM. I
tasted (very carefully!) a few microliters of the lighter fluid, and
that didn't seem to match the weird taste.</P>

<P>After about 15 minutes (while the other investigators smoked a
bong) I noticed significant pharmacological effects. At about 5:30 I
was experiencing effects consistent with a dose of about 3.0 mg/kg.
This suggests a yield in the 90% range. (about 315 mg of 350
recovered). At about this time, I took a couple of small bong hits
myself, which produced instant second plateau effects. This backs up
my assay of the dosage. At this time (9:30) I am still experiencing
light effects.</P>

<P>The new citric acid product now sits in Mr. Barris's refrigerator.
We plan to test it soon (possibly this weekend, Mar. 1 1996) and will
report.</P>

<H3><CENTER>11.1.4 &nbsp; Precipitation Method</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
If you want to use the precipitation method, all you have to do is
add sodium hydroxide to the cough formula as described above, until
the DXM precipitates out. Let it stand (or centrifuge it), and
filter. The (very fine) powder that hopefully was caught by the
filter paper is the DXM free base. I don't know whether the
precipitation method works with DXM+guaifenesin preparations.</P>

<H2><CENTER>11.2 &nbsp; How Can I Get Rid of Other Drug
Ingredients?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
I still haven't had a chance to find out much more about extraction
in the presence of other active ingredients (I work 60 hours a week).
Here is what I've found so far.</P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<HR SIZE=4>

<A NAME="toc.11.2.1"></A></P>

<H3><CENTER>11.2.1 &nbsp; Acetaminophen</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
It appears that acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) doesn't survive the
acid-base extraction process and so either of the above acid-base
processes, preferrably Agent Lemon, may work. However, I wouldn't bet
my life on it, and if you try this without some means of testing for
acetaminophen in the final product, that's exactly what you will be
doing.</P>

<P>If you want to try this out, find yourself a lab that can test for
acetaminophen and do some research. It <I>may</I> be possible to test
for acetaminophen, then again this test may not be effective. See
<A HREF="#toc.11.3">Section 11.3</A> for one reader's suggestion.</P>

<P>The other option is to use acetaminophen's low solubility in cold
water to your advantage (this is frequently done by people who
extract the codeine from codeine+acetaminophen tablets). The theory
is that if you take your product dissolved in water and chill it to
near freezing, the acetaminophen will become insoluble, and you can
filter it out. If you want to try this, do it with the end product of
the Agent Lemon process; chilling cough syrup will leave you with a
thick goo that isn't easily filtered.</P>

<P>Again, let me emphasize: go ahead and try this if you have access
to a lab that can test for acetaminophen; otherwise, don't risk liver
damage or death. It's relatively easy to get cough syrups without
acetaminophen anyway.</P>

<P><BR>
Most antihistamines, and all decongestants, are alkaloids, and thus
will follow DXM in the extraction processes. The only easy method for
isolating these from the DXM that I can think of would be
differential solubility.</P>

<P>The basic principle behind differential solubility is that
different chemicals are soluble in different solvents. The relevant
solvents that I have come up with (from various sources) are:</P>

<P>This information is from the Merck Index; I'm trying to fill in
the unknowns from other sources. In particular, I'm fairly certain
that DXM free base is soluble in ether, and that d-pseudoephedrine
HCl is insoluble in ether. <I>Note: I know, I had this backwards
before</I> due to a typo.</P>

<P>As you can see, DXM and pseudoephedrine pretty much behave alike
in solvents. This is the problem. If anyone can come up with a
solution, feel free to make suggestions. Until then, stick with
extracting from DXM-only or DXM+gauifenesin products.</P>

<H2><CENTER>11.3 &nbsp; How Can I Test for
Acetaminophen?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Based on the suggestion of one reader, it appears that a fairly
simple test will detect acetaminophen, at least in neutral, aqueous
solutions. I have briefly verified this, but not in detail, and I
haven't checked to see if the results are backed up by a lab.</P>

<P>Acetaminophen turns a purplish-brown color on reaction with sodium
hydroxide (NaOH). This is a fairly rapid reaction, which you can try
out yourself by dissolving an acetaminophen tablet in water and
adding some of this solution to a sodium hydroxide solution. It does
not appear that ammonia will work instead of sodium hydroxide.
However, since you aren't going to be ingesting the final product,
feel free to use lye instead of reagent grade sodium hydroxide.</P>

<P>So let's say you have a solution which you think may contain
acetaminophen. Call it Solution A. Prepare a <I>concentrated</I>
sodium hydroxide solution (Solution B) by dissolving as much sodium
hydroxide as you can in a small amount (say, 50mL) of water. Be
careful and wear your safety glasses! Now, take a dropper, and add a
little bit of Solution A into Solution B. If you see a purple or
brown color form, you can bet that there's acetaminophen in your
Solution A.</P>

<P>The problem is, if you don't see any color, that doesn't
necessarily mean the acetaminophen (or some byproduct of it from the
extraction) isn't there. Now, it may be that this is an effective
test for detecting the presence and absence of acetaminophen, but I'm
not sure yet. So consider this a point for further research, and
nothing more.</P>

<A NAME="toc.11.4"></A></P>

<H2><CENTER>11.4 &nbsp; How do I Use Free Base DXM?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The DXM you extracted is in free base form, so it is theoretically
possible to smoke it using a vaporization pipe. This is, however, a
difficult task; if you overheat it, it starts to smell like burning
plastic, and in any case it's very harsh. Some have suggested that
it's actually the small amounts of flavoring (and possibly thickening
agents) left over from the extraction that are causing the problem;
to my knowledge, though, even pure DXM is hard to smoke because of
its high vaporization point.</P>

<P>One person reported that he was able to smoke freebase dextrorphan
but not DXM, as the former would vaporize at a reasonable temperature
while the latter would not. Another person reported one successful
attempt at freebasing DXM, but said his lungs immediately began to
hurt intensely and his breathing passages swelled to the point that
he had to use an asthma inhaler and antihistamines. Generally, the
consensus is that smoking DXM just isn't worth the trouble.</P>

<P>You can also dissolve it in alcohol, or load it into a capsule,
and swallow it. In an ideal world, the hydrochloric acid in your
stomach would react with the DXM to form DXM hydrochloride, which
could then be absorbed. Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal
world, so it might be a good idea to form an acid salt with citric
acid (or use the Agent Lemon process). The other option is to eat
food with the DXM to increase both stomach acid production and lipid
transport. <B>Please note that using excess HCl may convert the DXM
to dextrorphan.</B> Incidentally, DXM itself tastes really nasty.</P>

<P>Or, you can use the free base DXM for further syntheses - see
<A HREF="#toc.11.6">Section 11.6</A>.</P>

<H2><CENTER>11.6 &nbsp; What Can I Synthesize From DXM?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
All chemical processes in this section require pure DXM. If you do
not have pure DXM, you must extract from cough formulae as above (and
purify it really well). Most of these processes require significant
skill, and access to lab equipment and chemicals. To my knowledge
none of this is illegal (but don't take my word on it). Don't fret if
your yields aren't as good as specified. Most of the procedures are
from the same source (<A HREF="refs.html#r96">96</A>).</P>

<P>

<HR>

<A NAME="toc.11.6.1"></A></P>

<H3><CENTER>11.6.1 &nbsp; Dextrorphan</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
This is probably the easiest by far. In fact, it's often accidental
in the isolation of pure DXM. Any excess of acid (HCl or HBr) should
produce dextrorphan. The primary reference for this section
(<A HREF="refs.html#r96">96</A>) used 48% HBr. It is possible that
this occurs accidentally in some extraction procedures where HCl is
used to convert DXM free base to water-soluble form. This may account
for people indicating that extracted DXM is stronger than DXM in
cough formulae. According to one user, DXO can be freebased at 190 C
(pers. comm.).</P>

<H3><CENTER>11.6.2 &nbsp; Levorphanol / Levomethorphan</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
These compounds would most likely have opiate activity.
Unfortunately, as someone (wish I remembered who!) once put it, the
isomer fairy isn't going to descend from heaven and wave her magic
wand. You'd basically have to get the cross bridge to flip around (if
you could do this, the hydrogens would probably conform as desired).
Good luck! Personally, I don't think it can be done, at least not
easily. By the time you got the lab and chemicals to do it, it'd
probably be easier just to make methylfentanyl from scratch.</P>

<P>If you <B>do</B> figure out a way to do it, please don't tell
anyone; nothing would bring the DEA into this faster than someone
making an opiate out of DXM. You don't need to tell me either, since
I don't consider opiates to be much fun. Oh, and if the isomer fairy
does show up, you might as well ask her to make you some
methamphetamine from Vicks Nasal

<H3><CENTER>11.6.3 &nbsp; 3-Substituted Analogs</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Several 3-substituted DXM analogs have been synthesized. A few of
these actually show interesting binding and anticonvulsant activity.
Table 4, on the following page, lists the analogs, their binding, and
their anticonvulsant activity in rats. All data on 3-substituted
analogs comes from (<A HREF="refs.html#r96">96</A>). Incidentally,
this article is marked as "not subject to US Copyright"; therefore
I've quoted large sections from it. Curiously enough, the research
was sponsored by NIDA (the National Institute on Drug Abuse).
<B>ED<SUB>50</SUB> Rats</B> refers to the effective dose for
anticonvulsant activity; <B>% Rats</B> refers to the percentage of
rats protected. Sample size was 10 rats.</P>

<P>Some comments on the table. Both dextromethorphan and the
N(CH<SUB>3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB> derivative lost anticonvulsant activity
at higher doses. The NH<SUB>2</SUB>, OEt, and O2-Pr derivatives all
showed no indication of psychotomimetic activity at anticonvulsant
doses. Most showed little ability to displace
&#91;<SUP>3</SUP>H&#93;TCP. I think it's safe to say that the
&#91;<SUP>3</SUP>H&#93;TCP binding site is the NMDA open channel
PCP<SUB>1</SUB> site, and that the &#91;3H&#93;DXM binding is
occurring to DXM's high affinity sites (sigma<SUB>1</SUB> and
PCP<SUB>2</SUB>). The authors do not address the PCP<SUB>2</SUB>
site.</P>

<P>My guess is that the discrepancies between
&#91;<SUP>3</SUP>H&#93;DXM binding affinity and anticonvulsant
activity relate to different binding at sigma<SUB>1</SUB> and
PCP<SUB>2</SUB>, and that the anticonvulsant activity comes from the
sigma<SUB>1</SUB> activity. As far as any recreational use of these
derivatives goes, I have no idea. Potentially, the NH<SUB>2</SUB>
derivative might show effects limited to sigma<SUB>1</SUB> activity,
and the OEt and O2-Pr derivatives might show sigma<SUB>1</SUB> and
PCP<SUB>2</SUB> activity. It doubt any of the above are specific for
PCP<SUB>2</SUB>; the closest would be the H "derivative". This is all
scientific wild-assed guessing; there's not much data on
PCP<SUB>2</SUB> (or the sigma receptors for that matter).</P>

<P>So if you want to go about synthesizing any of these, I don't
believe it would be illegal (I could be wrong). I wouldn't advise
taking any of them, of course; in particular, there's been no
LD<SUB>50</SUB> determination. The authors doubt that the NCS
derivative even gets to the brain. If it <I>did</I> get to the brain,
it would likely bind irreversibly. You don't want that (imagine
tripping for three months with permanent brain damage).</P>

<P>Formerly I quoted the synth procedures from the articles; I
decided against that in this version of the FAQ. If you're
interested, go get the article.</P>
