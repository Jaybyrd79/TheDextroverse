<P><BR>
This section covers general information about dextromethorphan,
herein referred to as DXM. IUPAC chemical names are in a sans serif
font, in square brackets.</P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>PLEASE NOTE that the UK (and European?) name of
<B>acetaminophen</B> is <B>paracetamol</B>. It is also known as
<B>APAP</B>. They all refer to the same substance.

<P>If you get nothing else out of this FAQ, let it be this: Remember
that DXM is a powerful psychedelic which can be used safely, but must
be used with care and respect for your own body and mind. DXM is not
a safe drug, and it has not been well studied at recreational levels;
whenever you use it you are taking a risk, possibly a big one. Please
read and follow these basic guidelines:</P>

      <TD>
         <P><B>Dextromethorphan</B> (decks-tro-meth-OR-fan), or DXM,
         is a cough suppressant found in over-the-counter
         medications. It has also been used recreationally for at
         least 30 years, without much harm or publicity. Although
         chemically related to opiates, its effects are closest to
         ketamine's. In addition to suppressing coughs, DXM is used
         medically for diagnostic purposes, and may be useful for a
         variety of conditions from seizures to heroin addiction. In
         the brain, DXM blocks the dopamine reuptake site, activates
         the sigma receptor, and blocks the open NMDA channel. (None
         of these effects are permanent).</P>
         
         <P>Occasional recreational use of DXM is probably safe,
         though side effects and risks have been noted (I hereby tell
         you not to use any recreational drug including DXM). Many
         cough medicines contain ingredients other than DXM; some,
         like acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be fatal when an
         overdose is taken. The commercial preparations which can be
         used recreationally are those <B>containing DXM only</B> In
         the USA this includes mostly "Maximum Strength" cough
         formulas and Drixoral Cough Liquid
         Caps<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, and generic
         equivalents. All should list ONLY <I>dextromethorphan
         hydrobromide</I> under active ingredients. Avoid <I>Benylin
         DM</I><FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>. The above cough
         syrups have 3mg/ml (15mg per teaspoon), for 360mg per 4oz
         bottle and 720mg per 8oz bottle; the cough gelcaps have 30mg
         each. Preparations like <I>Robitussin
         DM</I><FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> contain
         guaifenesin and may cause vomiting.</P>
         
         <P><B>Never</B> take DXM with, or up to two weeks before or
         six weeks after, the prescription "non-drowsy"
         antihistamines (allergy medications)
         Seldane<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>,
         Claritin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, or

         take DXM with, or up to two weeks before or three weeks
         after, a MAOI (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor) - certain drugs
         for depression; you will probably be told by your doctor if
         your drug is a MAOI
         (Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> isn't).
         <B>Never</B> <B>drive under the influence of DXM</B>.
         <B>Don't</B> take DXM more than once or twice a week.
         <B>Don't </B>take DXM if you have a history of mental
         illness, panic attacks, seizures, liver, kidney, or heart
         disease. Some people react very badly to DXM; others don't
         experience anything at all, partly from inherited lack of an
         enzyme. Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> blocks
         this enzyme and may lengthen or change the DXM trip.
         Recreational DXM use may be illegal. DXM may cause false
         positives on drug tests.</P>
         
         <P>DXM trips vary depending on dosage, and can be lumped
         into four very different plateaus, or types of trips,
         depending on the amount taken. Dosages are given in
         milligrams per kilogram, so multiply the figure by your mass
         in kg (or pounds divided by 2.2). The first plateau, 1.5 to
         2.5 mg/kg, is like a slightly intoxicating stimulant; music
         and movement are often pleasurable. The second plateau, 2.5
         to 7.5 mg/kg, is intoxicating, with a "stoning" a bit like
         that of nitrous oxide or marijuana; sounds and sights seem
         to be on strobe-effect ("flanging"), short-term memory is
         somewhat disrupted, and there are occasional mild
         hallucinations. The third plateau, at 7.5 to 15mg/kg,
         consists of strong intoxication, hallucinations, and overall
         disturbances in thinking, senses, and memory; third plateau
         trips can be unpleasant. The fourth plateau, above 15mg/kg,
         is similar to a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine, with
         dissociation of the mind from the body, and may be dangerous
         physically and psychologically. Most recreational use of DXM
         happens at the first and second plateau. DXM starts to
         become toxic around 20 to 30mg/kg.</P>
         
         <P>While occasional recreational use of DXM is probably
         safe, some people react very badly to dissociatives,
         especially at high doses, and may panic. Frequent DXM use,
         like frequent alcohol use, is probably dangerous and should
         be avoided. Please be safe, sensible, and use your brain;
         it's the only one you'll ever have.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.2 &nbsp; What is Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
(DXM)?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
<IMG SRC="figure1.gif" WIDTH=233 HEIGHT=240 ALIGN=left vspace=4 hspace=4>
Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is the water-soluble salt of
dextromethorphan (DXM) and hydrobromic acid (that is, DXM
hydrobromide is what you get when you react pure DXM with hydrobromic
acid). DXM is a synthetic morphine analog, similar to levorphanol,
but does not have any opiate-like effects. DXM has been in use in the
USA for approximately 30 years, and has replaced codeine as an OTC
cough suppressant (<A HREF="refs.html#r1">1-3</A>).</P>

<P>DXM has been popular as an "underground" recreational drug for at
least 30 years (<A HREF="refs.html#r3">3</A>). It is probably one of
the few OTC medicines with any serious recreational use potential
(ephedrine might also qualify). It is both extremely safe and very
effective as a cough suppressant.</P>

<P>DXM's IUPAC name is
&#91;(+)-cis-1,3,4,9,10,10a-hexahydro-6-methoxy-
11-methyl-2H-10,4a-iminoethanophenanthrene&#93;, and is also (and
more commonly) known as
3-methoxy-17-methyl-(9alpha,13alpha,14alpha)-morphinan; CAS-125-71-3
(<A HREF="refs.html#r1">1</A>). Note: the 3-methoxy and 17-methyl
groups are pointed out for later notes.</P>

<P>(Oh, just as a side note, I'm proud to say that for once I
actually got the IUPAC name right all by myself - the Merck Index
lists the same thing).</P>

<P>The recreational use potential of DXM has not, in general, been
well known, either by drug users or by physicians. Not too long ago,
many physicians denied that dextromethorphan was psychoactive at all;
whether this was out of ignorance or a desire to prevent recreational
use, I do not know (probably the latter). At present, there is an
increasing body of knowledge about DXM's potential for recreational
use (and abuse) available in medical journals (<A HREF="refs.html#r3">3-7</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r132">132</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r136">136</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r139">139-141</A>).</P>

<P>DXM is unique among recreational drugs for several reasons. First,
it is pharmacologically unlike most other recreational drugs (PCP and
ketamine being its nearest relatives). Second, its effects can vary
considerably from individual to individual. Finally, it can cause
quite different effects at different dosage levels, ranging from mild
euphoria to full dissociation.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.3 &nbsp; What is Dextromethorphan
Polistirex?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Dextromethorphan Polistirex is a time-release formulation of DXM; the
"polistirex" refers to a sulfonated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer
complex -- basically, an edible plastic (<A HREF="refs.html#r1">1-2</A>).
It is occasionally spelled polystirex or polystyrex. Unlike the HBr
salt, which is absorbed fairly quickly, this compound is intended for
longer duration cough suppression. Most, but not all, people who use
DXM recreationally tend to prefer the HBr form (which is also much
more readily available). The polistirex preparation will probably
increase the ratio of DXM to DXO (see next section).</P>

<P><B>Dextromethorphan polistirex may be more toxic than the
hydrobromide version, possibly due to buildup of DXM in the
bloodstream </B> (<A HREF="refs.html#r143">143</A>).</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.4 &nbsp; What is Dextrorphan (DXO)?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Dextrorphan is a metabolite of DXM (i.e., the body converts DXM to
dextrorphan). The conversion from DXM to DXO occurs via removal of
the methyl group at position 6, a process called "O-demethylation".
DXO is very similar chemically to DXM, and reacts with the same
receptors in the body, but with a very different spectrum. Whereas
DXM is strongest at the PCP2 and sigma receptors, DXO primarily
targets the NMDA receptor (see <A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10">Section
10</A>).</P>

<P>The practical upshot is that the dissociative and intoxicating or
"stoning" effects are stronger with DXO, whereas the stimulation,
cognitive alterations, delusions, and psychotomimetic (literally,
"psychosis-like") effects are stronger with DXM. Most DXM users find
some balance between the two to be the most pleasurable. Too much
sigma activity is usually regarded as dysphoric (strongly unpleasant)
and disturbing, and if prolonged, may be dangerous (<A HREF="refs.html#r101">101</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r135">135</A>).</P>

<P>Fortunately, you don't have to worry about converting DXM to DXO;
the body does it for you via an enzyme called P450-2D6 or CYP2D6
(also called debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase). However, between 5 to 10%
of the Caucasian population lacks this enzyme (<A HREF="refs.html#r12">12-15</A>),
and in the rest of us it can vary. Many drugs can temporarily block
P450-2D6 from working (<A HREF="refs.html#r10">10-11</A>) and thus
alter the balance between DXM and DXO. For a list of these drugs, see
<A HREF="appendices.html#toc.15.1">Section 15.1</A>.</P>

<P>One of DXM's metabolites, 3-methoxymorphinan, can itself block
P450-2D6. As a consequence, taking a second dose some time after the
first dose of DXM will probably increase the ratio of DXM to DXO in
the bloodstream. Taking the dose all at once, on the other hand, will
probably increase the relative amount of DXO. Generally, then, the
quicker the dosing, the more DXO and less DXM, and the more NMDA
blockade (like ketamine) and the less sigma and PCP<SUB>2</SUB>
activity. Subcutaneous injection leads to very little conversion from
DXM to DXO.</P>

<P>When discussing effects, this text usually uses "DXM" to refer to
both dextromethorphan and its metabolite, DXO. A few people have used
DXO specifically; one indicated that it did in fact have fewer
cognitive effects than DXM.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.5 &nbsp; Is DXM Enjoyable as a Recreational
Drug?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
It depends on what you consider "enjoyable". Roughly one third of the
people who try DXM like it enough to ever repeat the experience; one
third hates it, and one third doesn't enjoy it enough to drink cough
syrup. Among those who do enjoy it, most report that their more
"profound" DXM experiences were in many ways also very unpleasant,
challening, and have a strong dysphoric undertone. Experienced
psychedelic users seem to enjoy DXM more than the inexperienced.
Generally speaking, enjoyable DXM experiences require putting a lot
of emotional and psychological energy into the experience.</P>

<P>DXM does not provide a simple high like marijuana, and it is not a
substitute for other psychedelics. Many people will not enjoy it;
before considering DXM, remember that you may hate the experience. If
you are looking for a cheap buzz or a gentle ride, you probably won't
like DXM.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.6 &nbsp; Is DXM an Opiate?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
No, it isn't. Sometimes people get confused because DXM's
stereoisomer (basically, the mirror image molecule), called
levomethorphan, is an opiate. In two dimensions the molecules look
identical, but in three dimensions, they are mirror images of each
other. DXM no more fits into opiate receptors than a left-hand
threaded screw will fit into a right-hand threaded nut.</P>

<P>In fact, DXM doesn't bind at any opiate receptors, doesn't have
opiate painkilling effects, and isn't cross-tolerant with opiates. It
is only out of sheer chance that when DXM was invented, its origins
were among the opiates; DXM's cough suppressant effects are
completely different in mechanism from the cough suppressant effects
of opiates.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.7 &nbsp; Does Everyone Like DXM?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
No, in fact from speaking with many people who have tried it, only
about one third of the people who try it ever take it again. One
third seem to absolutely hate it, and the last third couldn't care
less. Among the third who do like it, the majority (around 80% of
those who like DXM) take it once a month or less.</P>

<P>Part of the problem is that not everyone gets the interesting sets
of effects (see <A HREF="dxm_experience.html#toc.5">Section 5</A>).
To some, the DXM trip is just a moderate buzzing sensation and a
feeling of being slightly drunk. So your mileage may vary.</P>

<P>A few people really enjoy DXM, and use it weekly; a very few (less
than 5% of those who like DXM) use it more than twice a week. Keep in
mind that I have not assessed the error margin on these figures, and
that they reflect a biased sample of the population. I hope to have
more accurate figures after completing a survey of DXM users.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.8 &nbsp; How Does One Obtain and Use DXM?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
DXM is available at drugstores throughout the world, chemical
suppliers, and (very rarely) as a street drug. Generally, however, I
wouldn't trust anyone saying he or she had DXM on the street; it's
probably ketamine, PCP, or something totally unrelated.</P>

<P>DXM is most commonly available in cough syrups, though some syrups
contain other ingredients which can make you sick (or dead) if you
take too much of them. It is also available in gelcaps and in some
places in capsules, either alone or in combination with other
ingredients.</P>

<P>DXM can also be extracted from cough medicines, and the extract
can be taken orally, injected subcutaneously, intraperitoneally,
intramuscuarly, or intravenously. It can probably also be snorted or
used rectally (though why one would want to I don't know). Smoking
the free base is very difficult if not impossible. DXO (not DXM) free
base can be smoked at 190 C (pers. comm.).</P>

<P>Some drugstores keep track of people who frequently buy
DXM-containing cough preparations, especially if they buy multiple
bottles at once or tend not to buy other things at the same time.
This is less common in larger supermarket/drug stores. In some cities
where DXM use has become popular (and come to public attention),
sales have been restricted to adults. In Utah in the 1980's, DXM was
placed behind the counter due to recreational use.</P>

<P>Finally, DXM is available from chemical suppliers, very few of
which will sell to individuals.</P>

<P>Hopefully I'll soon be finished with the "Find the DXM" page,
which allows people to find out which DXM preparations are available
in their areas. Don't hold your breath, though; I'm a sysadmin at a
small ISP and that doesn't leave me with a lot of time.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.8.1 &nbsp; Cough Syrups</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM is widely available in cough syrups, both brand-name (such as
<I>Robitussin</I><FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> or <I>Vicks
Formula 44</I><FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) and store brands.
Most DXM-containing cough syrups also contain one or more of the
following other active ingredients: nasal decongestants,
antihistamines, acetaminophen, or guaifenesin (see <A HREF="#toc.4.11">Section
4.11</A>). As a rule, you want to avoid all of them.</P>

<P>Generally speaking, DXM cough syrups all taste nasty. This is for
two reasons: to cover up the (even nastier) taste of DXM itself, and
to prevent recreational use. The generics tend to be less thick, and
thus more drinkable, than the brand names. Some people prefer to mix
the DXM with sodas; others find this only makes an already unpleasant
task even more unpleasant. Your Mileage May Vary.</P>

<P>Most people who have used DXM cough syrups recreationally seem to
prefer to take it on a mostly empty stomach, possibly with crackers
or some other source of carbohydrates. I generally feel that you
should avoid slamming your kidneys and pancreas with a lot of glucose
at once; thus I think some crackers or chips beforehand would be
advisable. Greasy food should be avoided both before and after taking
DXM. Most people report that if carbonated drinks are ingested, they
should be clear (e.g., 7-Up<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>).</P>

<P>The German company "Dr Rentschler" makes a cough syrup called
"tuss hustenstiller saft".</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.8.2 &nbsp; Gelcaps</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
There are "gelcaps" (liquid or gel filled capsules) available that
contain DXM, but they tend to be brand-name only. The most frequent
(if not only) brand in the US is <I>Drixoral Cough Liquid
Caps</I><FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>. They come in boxes of
10 or 20 gel capsules, each containing 30mg of DXM. The gel capsule
itself is red colored; the liquid inside is actually clear (and
tastes very, very bad). The capsules are somewhat large, and
difficult if not impossible to take without liquid to wash them down.
This brand also comes with a $0.50 or $1.00 manufacturer's coupon
inside, which some have taken to calling
<I>Drixoral</I><FONT SIZE="-2"><I><SUP>TM</SUP></I></FONT><I>
Dollars</I> (after <I>Camel
Bucks</I><FONT SIZE="-2"><I><SUP>TM</SUP></I></FONT>, a fake currency
coupon in Camel<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> cigarettes which
could be collected and "spent" on various stuff, unfortunately not
including iron lungs and chemotherapy). Note that Drixoral also makes
several other liquid and capsule products, all of which contain
undesirable active ingredients besides DXM.</P>

<P>Recently, Drixoral Cough Liquid Caps have been getting harder and
harder to find. The usual story from the drugstores is that they
aren't very popular; my suspicion is that they are too popular. Look
around, and you will probably be able to find them. There is a rumor
going around that the "new" gelcaps have something in the coating
that induces nausea, but I have found no evidence for this
whatsoever. The ingredient list hasn't changed, and changing
ingredients without making it public is strictly</P>

<P>Absorption from the gelcaps takes some time, and can be sped up
somewhat by cracking open each gelcap in your mouth before it is
swallowed. Note, however, that the liquid inside is apt to spurt out,
and it tastes bad. Really, really bad - sour and bitter and cloying
all at once with a stickiness that won't go away. However, if you can
stand it, you can become used to it after the first few gelcaps. You
can also crack open the gelcaps and try to collect the liquid, but it
tends to go everywhere.</P>

<P>Some people have claimed that gelcap DXM "feels" different from
cough syrup DXM. This may be pure placebo effect, or it may be a
result of the slower absorption (and thus more DXM vs. DXO) of
gelcaps. It is also possible that the "inactive" ingredients in cough
syrup may affect the experience by altering blood glucose levels.
Most seem to prefer the gelcap "feel".</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.8.3 &nbsp; Tablets and Capsules (including
Coricidin)</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
A variety of DXM-only pill brands are available throughout the world;
unfortunately, none are available in the US. Some of the brands
include:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><I>Contac CoughCaps</I> (Canada)</LI>
   
   <LI><I>Romilar</I> (southeast Asia and others)</LI>
   
   <LI><I>Dr. Rentschler tuss hustenstiller retard kapseln</I>
   (Germany)</LI>
   
   <LI><I>Everest</I> (Taipei and others)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Please let me know if you learn of any others.</P>

<P>DXM pills typically contain 15 or 30 mg of DXM, but some (such as
the Dr. Rentschler brand, tuss Hustenstiller retard Kapseln) contain
60mg of DXM.</P>

<P>In the US, a new tablet brand, <I>Coricidin Cough &amp; Cold</I>,
is available. Containing 30mg DXM and 4mg chlorpheniramine maleate
(an antihistame), these have become popular for lower plateau dosing,
but can have extremely unpleasant anticholinergic side effects
(drymouth, blurred vision, confusion, etc.) with higher doses. One
person had to be hospitalized for vomiting blood and entering
respiratory arrest after taking a high dose of Coricidin tablets.
Even low doses often have unpleasant side effects and may be very
confusing. At the lower plateaus, the chlorpheniramine does seem to
alleviate the "Robo Itch" (see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.1.3">Section
6.1.3</A>). The box is marked "suitable for people with high blood
pressure" (Coricidin has other tablets available which are unsuitable
for recreational use).</P>

<P>Furthermore, many Coricidin seem to report that frequent use leads
to increasingly severe nausea triggered by taking, or even looking
at, the pills. Some people have been known to puke in the drugstore
from seeing the box (one user reported that 30+ people he knows
suffer from this). I have no idea why this would happen.</P>

<P>Again, remember that the antihistamine in these tablets will
change the character of the DXM trip (not necessarily in a good way),
potentially increasing the degree confusion. <B>Do not use this
product except at first and second plateau dosage!</B> An overdose of
antihistamine, while not typically fatal, can be extremely unpleasant
and has been reported to be a frequent cause of "bad trips" from
Coricidin. Most DXM users have recommended not taking more than eight
Coricidin tablets; some say not to use this product at all.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.8.4 &nbsp; Lozenges</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
There are a few brands of cough drops/lozenges which contain DXM
without other active ingredients. One such brand is
Sucrets<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> (not the kind that come
in the tin; these come in a bag and are labelled as containing DXM).
Each lozenge contains 15mg DXM, as well as a number of inert
ingredients (primarily sucrose, flavoring, coloring, magnesium
silicate). Some people report the sucrets contain menthol; others
don't (I suspect there may be different versions available). Other
lozenges available contain from 7.5mg DXM (a South African brand) to
30mg DXM. Revco carries a DXM lozenge containing 5mg DXM each called
Hold<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, which supposedly taste
better than Sucrets but are fairly expensive (and contain less
DXM).</P>

<P>Since the inert ingredients present in these lozenges may cause
nausea, some people have managed to get rid of most of them by
placing the lozenges in a container of water and microwaving until
fully dissolved, then filtering through a coffee filter, discarding
the precipitate (solid), and drinking the liquid. Longer boiling
seems to drive off the flavoring and menthol without affecting the
DXM.</P>

<P><I>Interesting side note: recently, in South Africa, cough
lozenges containing an abnormally high amount of DXM were illegally
diverted from disposal and resold, causing "moderately severe"
toxicity in 24% of primary school pupils using these lozenges
(</I><A HREF="refs.html#r369"><I>369</I></A><I>)</I>.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.8.5 &nbsp; Pharmaceutical and Chemical
Suppliers</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM is not DEA scheduled in the USA (or most other parts of the
world), and consequently should be available via pharmaceutical
chemical suppliers. For example, Sigma Chemical Company
(1-800-325-3010) lists DXM hydrobromide (product D2531) for US $18.20
for 5 grams, US $128.45 for 50 grams. Note that I have no affiliation
with Sigma in any way; I just happened to have a copy of their
catalog handy when writing this.</P>

<P>In theory, it would be fantastically cheap and easy to order DXM
this way; in practice, it's possibly difficult, and probably a Very
Bad Idea. First off, most chemical companies are wary about selling
to individuals (and if you're not a legal adult, forget it).
Secondly, there's a significant chance that your order will be
reported to the DEA, and although it's not technically illegal, if
enough people do this, that may change very quickly.</P>

<P>Still, though, if you have the (possibly foolish) courage to try,
there's no reason why this shouldn't be a reasonable source. Just use
your head. And don't mention the FAQ.</P>

<P>Recently, a few chemical resale companies have popped up, relying
upon the fact that many potentially useful chemicals can be sold
legally to researchers (for which there doesn't seem to be a legal
definition). <B>Please remember</B> that it is your responsibility to
make sure that ordering and using DXM from a chemical supplier is
legal in your area. Also, to my knowledge no chemical supplier (at
least, none you're likely to run across) warrants its product for
human consumption. Buyer beware!</P>

<P>Currently I know of two companies selling DXM (other than Sigma
and the like, which won't sell to individuals): <B>Chemical Resale of
Santa Barbara</B> and <B>WANMAN Enterprises</B>.</P>

<P><BR>
DXM can be extracted (see <A HREF="dxm_chemistry.html#toc.11">Section
11</A>) and the extracted DXM can be taken orally, either as free
base or as salt (the free base should convert to the hydrochloride
salt in your stomach). DXM is commercially available as the
hydrobromide salt (as well as polistirex), but DXM extraction
typically results in DXM citrate (see <A HREF="dxm_chemistry.html#toc.11.1.3">Section
11.1.3</A>). The free base tends to be somewhat alkaline and should
be avoided unless combined with food and/or juice (or other acidic
beverage). When taken on a mostly empty stomach, the extract is
generally (but not always) absorbed faster than cough syrups,
gelcaps, or capsules. Some extraction processes may convert some or
all of the DXM into dextrorphan (DXO). Extracted DXM, unlike cough
syrups and gelcaps, has no bromide toxicity (see <A HREF="#toc.4.11.7">Section
4.11.7</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.8.7 &nbsp; Injection and Other Routes</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM hydrobromide is reasonably soluble in saline, and I see no reason
why other acid salts shouldn't be - though their long-term stability
may be doubtful. However, <B>injection is a very dangerous way of
using recreational drugs, especially if the substance in question is
not prepared specifically to be injected</B>. Some of the potential
risks include: sterile abscesses, torn or collapsed veins, bruising,
muscle fiber damage, histamine release, infection (hepatitis B, HIV,
etc.), embolism (and possible resulting stroke or cardiac arrest),
increased chance of addiction, overdose, and people mistaking you for
a junky. True, most of these are unlikely, and if done correctly
injection is generally very safe. However, the key word is
<I>correctly</I>. If you're still interested, consult a medical text;
I'm not going to teach you how to shoot up.</P>

<P>A few notes for those brave or stupid enough to still be
interested. Intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) injection both
seem to produce similar results in animals, and IM injection is
almost always safer. DXM can also be injected intraperitoneally (IP),
but that evidently requires some skill. Subcutaneous (SC) injection
("skin popping") leads to slower absorption and a great increase in
the amount of DXM relative to DXO. All injected drugs should be
completely pure, dissolved in the appropriate physiological saline.
In the case of SC (and possibly IM) injection, injecting too large a
volume of material can lead to a sterile abscess.</P>

<P>DXM can also theoretically be snorted although I don't generally
think this is a very smart route; the nasal lining is very tender.
DXM free base is probably too alkaline to try this with. It can also
probably be used rectally, but somehow the thought of a cough syrup
enema doesn't thrill me.</P>

<P>Smoking DXM free base has been attempted several times by various
people without much success. DXM itself seems to vaporize at a fairly
high temperature, and is extremely harsh. To make matters worse, in
typical DXM extractions, some of the flavoring agents end up
surviving the extraction and they lend a definite unpleasant taste to
the smoke.</P>

<P>I have received one report of a successful DXM freebasing
experiment. The person said that while it was nice to know it was
possible, it was just too much trouble to be worth it. Another person
reported making the attempt and suffering from a severe burning
sensation in his lungs which ended up as an asthma attack.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.9 &nbsp; What are Some Typical DXM-Containing
Preparations?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
OK, I finally gave up on even trying to list commercial DXM
preparations because there are too many (not to mention they differ
from place to place even within the US). Instead, I list here the
typical DXM formulas and preparations you are likely to
encounter.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Pediatric Syrups (1-1.5mg/ml DXM)</FONT><BR>
   There are several brands and generics of "Pediatric" formulation
   DXM preparations. Intended for children, they contain very little
   DXM; on the other hand, they usually taste better. In general
   though it's a waste of money and time to try and use pediatric DXM
   formulas for recreational purposes.</LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Regular Strength Syrups (2mg/ml
   DXM)</FONT><BR>
   Many "regular strength" cough syrups contain 2mg/ml DXM. In the
   US, the most notable example is Vicks Formula
   44<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> (which formerly contained
   3mg/ml). These are of course quite usable for recreational
   purposes, although 3mg/ml syrups are preferred.</LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">"DM" Cough Syrups (2mg/ml DXM)</FONT><BR>
   Most of the "DM" cough syrups (of which the notable brand is
   Robitussin DM<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) contain 2mg/ml
   DXM as well as gauifenesin. During the 1980's, many of these
   syrups contained 3mg/ml DXM but were reduced in strength in
   response to recreational use. These syrups can also be used
   recreationally, but note that the guaifenesin can cause nausea or
   vomiting (see <A HREF="#toc.4.11.3">Section 4.11.3</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Maximum Strength Cough Syrups (3mg/ml
   DXM)</FONT><BR>
   The strongest syrups regularly available in the US are 3mg/ml and
   are typically marked "Maximum Strength Cough" (of which
   Robitussin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> is the most notable
   example). The generics are almost always called "Tussin Maximum
   Strength Cough". These are the most commonly used syrups for
   recreational purposes.</LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Concentrate Syrups (6mg/ml DXM)</FONT><BR>
   There are a very few brands of "concentrate" syrups, which are
   intended for institutions (or large families) who buy the
   concentrate and dilute it, possibly adding flavoring. The only
   brand I've ever heard of is
   Pinex<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>. Good luck trying to
   find these.</LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Gelcaps (30mg DXM)</FONT><BR>
   Drixoral Cough Liquid Caps<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> are
   available in the US (and possibly other places), and contain 30mg
   DXM in a gel capsule. These are sporadically available; if you
   can't find them in your area, try elsewhere.</LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Lozenges (7.5mg - 30mg DXM)</FONT><BR>
   A few lozenges are available which contain DXM. In the US, the
   only brand I'm aware of is
   Sucrets<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, which contain 15mg of
   DXM (see above notes on <A HREF="#toc.4.8.4">Section 4.8.4</A>).
   Another brand containing 7.5mg DXM is available in South
   Africa.</LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Capsules and Tablets (15mg - 60mg
   DXM)</FONT><BR>
   Various capsules and tablets are available throughout the world
   containing only DXM (to my knowledge, none are available in the

<H2><CENTER>4.11 &nbsp; What Should I Know About Other Drug
Ingredients?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
There are five main classes of active ingredients that are present in
OTC DXM-containing products: decongestants, antihistamines,
guaifenesin, analgesics, and alcohol. Each will be discussed in turn,
followed by "inactive" ingredients. With the possible exception of
alcohol, all should be avoided, although for differing reasons. Some
of these other active ingredients will make your experience
unpleasant; others can kill you. Additionally, some of the dyes and
other "inactive" ingredients may cause some people trouble.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.4.11.1"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>4.11.1 &nbsp; Decongestants</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
There are three nasal decongestants that are used in OTC cough
formulas in the USA: PPA, pseudoephedrine, and phenyleprine (the
latter is almost always found with antihistamines). PPA is also known
as phenylpropanolamine (from which the acronym PPA is derived),
norephedrine, and the IUPAC name &#91;alpha-(1-aminoethyl)benzyl
alcohol&#93;. Pseudoephedrine, known as the brand name
Sudafed<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, has the IUPAC name
&#91;(+)alpha-(1-methylamino)benzyl alcohol&#93;. Phenyleprine is
&#91;(-)-3-hydroxy-alpha-(methylaminomethyl)benzyl alcohol&#93;
(<A HREF="refs.html#r1">1-2</A>).</P>

<P>These decongestants belong to a class of chemicals known as the
phenethylamines; this class also includes methamphetamine, MDMA
(ecstasy), MDA, etc., and tend to be DEA scheduled. Decongestants are
not scheduled by the DEA (this is USA laws) because they do not have
significant psychostimulant activity. Ephedrine, which is similar to
pseudoephedrine, and is (or was, depending on your state) available
throughout truck stops and mail-order pharmaceutical companies in the
USA, does have mild stimulant properties; thus its popularity as a
form of "legal speed". All of these drugs stimulate the sympathetic
nervous system (the "fight or flight" system) and are thus called
sympathomimetics.</P>

<P>What nasal decongestants do share with the more potent
amphetamines is the peripheral activity common to sympathomimetics,
such as vasoconstriction (constriction of blood vessels) and
decreased nasal secretions (the good side), and - with larger doses -
insomnia, hypertension, heart rhythm abnormalities, hemorrhaging,
stroke, or death (the bad side) (<A HREF="refs.html#r8">8</A>). Note
that these are extreme reactions, and that individual tolerance to
sympathomimetics tends to vary considerably. Tolerance can build
quickly, and a fatal dose for one person may have only a mild effect
on another person.</P>

<P>Because of the potential danger of hypertension, exceeding the
recommended dose of DXM and decongestant containing preparations may
be asking for trouble. Most people can probably handle it in smaller
recreational doses, but the peripheral "speediness" can be distinctly
unpleasant. Anyone with high blood pressure or the like has no
business taking large quantities of decongestants.</P>

<P>Finally, more recent research suggests that many of DXM's
potentially disturbing side effects (see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6">Section
6</A>) might be potentiated by any stimulant. Panic attacks,
hyperthermia, hypertensive crisis, and the like are notable examples.
In extreme cases, stroke or brain hemorrhage may be possible.</P>

<P>Conclusion: <EM> Possibly suitable for first plateau use only;
otherwise avoid these drugs!</EM></P>

<H3><CENTER>4.11.2 &nbsp; Antihistamines</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The antihistamines operate by blocking histamine receptors (see
<A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10.1">Section 10.1</A> for an
explanation of receptors). Peripherally, this has the effect of
reducing the symptoms of histamine activity (stuffy and runny nose,
itchy eyes, hives, rashes, etc.) associated with infections and
allergies. In the brain, histamine is partially responsible for
wakefulness, and antihistamines that cross the blood-brain barrier
will cause sleepiness. In fact, most OTC "sleeping pills" in the USA
are really just antihistamines (although melatonin is making inroads
as an alternative). There are antihistamines that do not cross the
blood-brain barrier (e.g.,
Seldane<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) but these are
prescription in the USA.</P>

<P>High doses of antihistamines can result in dizziness, impairment
of concentration, extreme sedation (or, paradoxically, insomnia),
headache, heart palpitations, dry mouth, gastric discomfort,
delusions, and abnormally high blood pressure. Doses of 30-60mg/kg
have been fatal in very young children; most adults, however, are
very unlikely to overdose on antihistamines. Death, when it does
occur, is from cardiovascular collapse or respiratory arrest
(<A HREF="refs.html#r8">8</A>). High doses of prescription
antihistamines are much more dangerous; <B>do not</B> mix DXM with
prescription antihistamines!</P>

<P>The danger of an antihistamine overdose is very low when using a
DXM-containing product recreationally. However, you will most likely
experience some unpleasant symptoms, such as sleepiness, dry mouth,
heart palpitations, etc. These side effects increase as the dosage
increases. A very small amount of antihistamines might be useful in
preventing DXM-induced histamine release.</P>

<P>Conclusion: <EM>Traditional antihistamines may be suitable for
first and second plateau dosage levels, but should not be used at the
upper plateaus. NEVER use DXM with prescription, non-drowsy
antihistamines!</EM></P>

<H3><CENTER>4.11.3 &nbsp; Guaifenesin</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Guaifenesin (gwye-FEN-a-sin)
&#91;3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-1,2-propanediol&#93; is an expectorant; it
increases the production of respiratory tract fluids, thus making
phlegm less viscous and easier to cough up. Guaifenesin has been
shown effective as an expectorant, but is of no use as a cough
suppressant. It is often combined with dextromethorphan. Guaifenesin
should not be used for chronic coughs or coughs accompanied by
excessive phlegm (<A HREF="refs.html#r1">1-2</A>).</P>

<P>High doses of guaifenesin tend to induce emesis (i.e., you puke).
Other effects from high guaifenesin doses are not well known, but
probably not serious. Some suggest that guaifenesin may act as a
muscle relaxant at high doses (an effect for which it is used in
veterinary medicine).</P>

<P>Conclusion: <EM>as most people do not enjoy vomiting, I would
recommend avoiding guaifenesin-containing products.</EM></P>

<H3><CENTER>4.11.4 &nbsp; Analgesics,
Acetaminophen/Paracetamol</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol and APAP, is the most common
analgesic (painkiller) present in cough suppressant formulas. It is
closely related to the NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
of which aspirin and ibuprofen are the two most common examples.
Unlike the OTC NSAIDs, however, acetaminophen/paracetamol does not
tend to irritate the stomach, and thus its inclusion in cough
syrups.</P>

<P>An acetaminophen overdose is very dangerous. Normally,
acetaminophen is metabolized (broken down) in the body by two
separate pathways, both of which lead to harmless metabolites.
However, these two pathways can only handle so much before
saturating. At that point, the remaining acetaminophen is metabolized
by a cytochrome P450 liver enzyme. The metabolite via the P450
pathway is toxic to the liver (<A HREF="refs.html#r2">2</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r8">8</A>).</P>

<P>Furthermore, this doesn't happen right away; it can take 16 hours
before any signs of liver damage show up. This delayed toxic effect
has been responsible for the rather painful deaths of some people who
(accidentally or not) overdose on acetaminophen, and then think they
are fine when no immediate problems occur. There is an antidote
(acetylcystine), but it must be administered within the first 12 to
16 hours.</P>

<P>The toxic dose of acetaminophen can be as low as 50mg/kg; for a
60kg person this is only six acetaminophen tablets. This is unlikely
but possible. <STRONG>DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE
RECREATIONALLY ANY DXM PRODUCT WHICH ALSO CONTAINS ACETAMINOPHEN /
PARACETAMOL!</STRONG></P>

<P>As for aspirin and ibuprofen, the other two most common OTC
painkillers, both tend to irritate the stomach at high doses. I
recommend against them, especially if you have an irritable stomach.
<EM> Never take large doses of aspirin or ibuprofen if you have an
ulcer.</EM></P>

<P>Conclusion: <EM>avoid any product containing an
analgeisc.</EM></P>

<H3><CENTER>4.11.5 &nbsp; Alcohol</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Most cough syrups contain some alcohol, to help dissolve the DXM (and
other drugs) and to numb the throat. With a few exceptions (such as
Nyquil<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>), the amount of alcohol is
not usually very great. While alcohol does not, in general, mix well
with DXM as a recreational drug, the amount in cough syrups should
not cause trouble unless you are specifically sensitive to, or
attempting to avoid, alcohol. There are alcohol-free preparations
available; gelcaps and tablets are alcohol-free.</P>

<P><BR>
Some of the dyes used in cough formulas may give some people allergic
reactions. Most notable among these is tartrazine (FD&amp;C Yellow
#5). Generally, these dyes are not a problem unless you take a lot of
them (which recreational DXM use may involve). If you think you may
be allergic to a dye, switch to a different brand (or more
accurately, a different color). It is also a good idea to keep an
antihistamine (not a prescription or non-drowsy one!) nearby in case
an allergic reaction does occur.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.11.7 &nbsp; Bromide Ions</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM is usually ingested as a hydrobromide salt. Large amounts of
bromide ions can cause sedation and eventually lead to bromism
(bromide poisoning), which affects (among other things) the skin and
nervous system (see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.3.15">Section
6.3.15</A>. I don't think this is terribly relevant for users of DXM
(recreational or not); however it is one more reason to avoid
prolonged high-dose use. You can avoid bromide ions by converting the
DXM to free base and/or hydrochloride salt (see <A HREF="dxm_chemistry.html#toc.11.1">Section
11.1</A>). Some physicians do believe that prolonged heavy use of DXM
may lead to bromism (<A HREF="refs.html#r144">144</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.11.8 &nbsp; Other "Inactive" Ingredients</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Cough syrups tend to contain several thickening and sweetening
agents. Glucose, sucrose, invert sugar, and fructose are all commonly
used as sweetening agents. Obviously, a person with blood sugar
problems (diabetes or hypoglycemia) should not take large amounts of
these syrups. "Diabetic" syrups are available.</P>

<P>Thickening agents don't generally cause problems other than
nausea. Occasionally people will look on cough syrup labels and see
propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, and (thinking about ethylene
glycol, i.e., antifreeze) worry about toxicity. Propylene glycol is
not toxic, even though ethylene glycol is. The same goes for
polyethylene glycol (PEG) - it's also nontoxic. About the worst you
will get from any of these is an upset stomach.</P>

<P>One general note - keep in mind that your body does eventually
have to use or excrete whatever you eat and drink. Drinking huge
amounts of sugars and thickening agents can put a fair amount of load
on the pancreas and kidneys and should definitely be avoided if you
have kidney problems already. There is anecdotal evidence that
regular high-dose use of DXM cough syrups (without eating much) has
led to kidney damage due to the glucose load (though I suspect
rhabdoymolysis may be the cause -- see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.2.7">Section
6.2.7</A>. I cannot confirm this but I can't disprove it either. I've
also heard of people having blood sugar problems after repeated use
of DXM cough syrups, but again I can't verify this.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.12 &nbsp; Why are So Many DXM Preparations in Liquid
Form?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Cough preparations are in liquid form for two reasons. First and
foremost, most people have the (mistaken) belief that in order for a
cough suppressant formula to work, it must coat the throat. While
this may be true for local anaesthetics, in the case of DXM (or
codeine for that matter), it's complete bunk. If consumers were a bit
smarter, maybe we wouldn't have to gag down cough syrup. There are,
in fact, gel-capsule cough suppressants on the market, and I expect
that tablet or capsule dextromethorphan will eventually be more
common.</P>

<P>Second, tablet-form DXM preparations have been kept from the
market in an attempt to prevent their recreational use.
Romilar<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> tablets used to be
available in the US, but were removed from the market due to concerns
about their abuse. Other DXM formulas have been reduced in strength,
or combined with other ingredients, in an attempt to prevent or
reduce recreational use potential.</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.13 &nbsp; Is Recreational Use of DXM
Illegal?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Possibly. There may be laws making it a crime to use OTC medicines in
any way other than directed on the label. Not that this stops people
from using ephedrine (a bronchodilator) as a stimulant. Nor are you
likely to get caught and/or prosecuted; the authorities are much too
busy infringing upon our civil rights looking for the illegal drugs.
But, remember - I SPECIFICALLY instruct you NOT to use any medicine
in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.</P>

<P>Furthermore, suggesting to someone that they use DXM as a
recreational drug could also be violating a law - against prescribing
drugs as a layperson. Again, it's not likely to happen, but it is
possible.</P>

<P>DXM is a prescription drug in Sweden (<A HREF="refs.html#r9">9</A>).
It is prescription and scheduled in Australia unless combined with
other active ingredients. It may become prescription in other
countries. In drug stores in some areas it is kept behind the
counter, must be requested, and is only sold to adults.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.4.14"></A></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>4.14 &nbsp; If DXM is Legal Why Isn't Everyone Doing
It?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
A lot of reasons, actually. Beyond the obvious one that not everyone
knows about it are a number of reasons which may be more relevant.
First and foremost, DXM doesn't appeal to everyone; in fact, it seems
to follow a "rule of thirds". One third of people who try DXM like
it, one third hate it, and one third could care less.</P>

<P>Secondly, doing DXM is either disgusting or a time-consuming
process for most people. Cough syrup tastes bad, and is unpleasant to
drink; even the gelcaps become unpleasant to take after a few times
due to their rather large size. DXM can of course be extracted, but
it is a time-consuming process that requires enough effort to
discourage those only casually interested.</P>

<P>Third, DXM is to a certain extent "anti-addictive", at least when
used occasionally. Because DXM blocks NMDA receptors (see <A HREF="physiological.html#toc.9">Section
9</A> and <A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10.3">Section 10.3</A>), it
prevents associating any pleasant effects of the drug with the taking
of the drug. Instead, the memories of taking the drug are associated
with sensations <I>before</I> the DXM kicks in, e.g., nausea.</P>

<P>Fourth, DXM trips can be extremely confusing, especially if the
user doesn't have experience with psychedelics. The DXM trip is so
unlike an LSD or mushroom trip that people who take it expecting the
latter are often discouraged and do not repeat the experience.</P>

<P>Finally, DXM has a reputation as a "loser drug", something people
take when nothing else is available. While it's true that DXM is
legal, and thus <I>can</I> in fact be taken when nothing else is
available, this doesn't make it any less powerful (or any safer) than
illegal drugs.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.15.1 &nbsp; Diagnostic Uses</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Cytochrome P450-2D6, also known as CYP2D6 or debrisoquine
hydroxylase, is a liver enyme which is extensively involved in
metabolizing drugs. Many drugs are metabolized by P450-2D6, and many
drugs also inhibit it. Some people are genetically lacking in the
normal P450-2D6 variant, and physicians will use DXM to determine
which variant of P450-2D6 a patient has (<A HREF="refs.html#r10">10-11</A>).
About 5-10% of Caucasians and 0.5% of Asians seem to lack P450-2D6
entirely, or have a very inactive mutation (<A HREF="refs.html#r12">12-15</A>).
In remaining individuals, its activity can vary significantly due to
genetic factors (<A HREF="refs.html#r15">15-18</A>). Between 0.5% and
2% of the population has multiple copies of the P450-2D6 gene and
will metabolize 2D6-dependent drugs much more quickly than most
people (<A HREF="refs.html#r155">155</A>).</P>

<P>Since many drugs become toxic at high doses, it is important to
give the proper amount to those people who will metabolize it
differently than the normal population. DXM is used to test
metabolism by CYP2D6. The patient is given a specific amount of DXM,
and then the relative concentrations of DXM and its metabolites are
determined.</P>

<P>Some recent research suggests that susceptibility to lung cancer
may be related to P450 variant, and DXM may be an effective
diagnostic tool for predicting lung cancer susceptibility (<A HREF="refs.html#r376">376</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.15.2 &nbsp; Neuroprotectant Uses</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
One area in which DXM (as well as other NMDA blockers; see <A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10.3">Section
10.3</A>) shows great promise is in the prevention of brain damage
resulting from excitotoxicity (over-stimulation of nerve cells to the
point of cell death) and other types of nerve cell damage (<A HREF="refs.html#r19">19</A>).
DXM may reduce or eliminate the brain damage resulting from
conditions such as fever, hypoxia (lack of oxygen) (<A HREF="refs.html#r20">20</A>),
ischemia (cutoff of blood to brain cells) (<A HREF="refs.html#r21">21-22</A>),
physical injury (<A HREF="refs.html#r23">23</A>), infection (such as
poliomyelitis, encephalitis, and meningitis), stroke, seizure, drug
toxicity (<A HREF="refs.html#r24">24-25</A>), electrical shock
(<A HREF="refs.html#r231">231</A>), hypoglycaemia (<A HREF="refs.html#r243">243</A>),
and withdrawal from long-term dependence upon certain drugs (notably
alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines such as
Valium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) (<A HREF="refs.html#r26">26-29</A>).</P>

<P>In the case of infection (and in particular poliomyelitis), it has
been demonstrated that the damage to the CNS often occurs not from
the infection, but from the body's own defenses, and notably from a
chemical called quinolinic acid (a metabolite of tryptophan)
(<A HREF="refs.html#r30">30</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r31">31</A>).
Quinolinic acid is a very potent agonist (activator) at excitatory
amino acid receptors, of which NMDA is one type; DXM prevents
quinolinic acid from activating NMDA receptors. (Incidentally, the
function of quinolinic acid - if it has any - is not currently known;
it may be involved in the immune response).</P>

<P>As for physical trauma, hypoxia, seizure, stroke, etc., there are
several experiments which indicate that the majority of the damage
again comes from excitotoxicity at excitatory amino acid receptors.
While DXM has shown somewhat less success there (possibly due to
other factors being involved), it still has potential.</P>

<P>DXM is currently being evaluated as an anticonvulsant (<A HREF="refs.html#r32">32</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r33">33</A>).
The animal data are somewhat conflicting, but the most accurate model
of epileptic seizures (called <I>kindling</I>) responds well to DXM.
Preliminary studies in humans indicates that even very low levels of
DXM may help prevent seizures. This effect is not, as was originally
thought, due to NMDA receptors; instead, it is probably due to sigma
receptors or voltage-gated ion channels (<A HREF="refs.html#r32">32</A>).</P>

<P>Interestingly, DXM produces different side-effects in kindled
(seizure-susceptible) animals than in non-kindled animals (this may
be due to uncoupling of NMDA receptors). It is possible that humans
susceptible to seizure may experience different effects from
recreational DXM use.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.15.3 &nbsp; DXM for Chronic Pain</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM seems to enhance the painkilling ability of opiates without
adding to the side effects, and in practice the patient can lower the
dose of opiates while maintaining analgesic effect (<A HREF="refs.html#r37">37</A>).
As an added bonus, DXM seems to prevent opiate tolerance (see next
section). DXM by itself has only marginal analgesic effect if any
(<A HREF="refs.html#r373">373</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r375">375</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.15.4 &nbsp; DXM for Drug Addiction</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM, as well as other dissociatives, seems to prevent and even
reverse tolerance to (and thus physical addiction to) many drugs. In
the case of opiates, DXM has been used to treat withdrawal symptoms
(<A HREF="refs.html#r169">169</A>). DXM plus diazepam
(Valium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) was tested and found to
be more effective at combating the symptoms of heroin withdrawal
(goose flesh, tremors, pupil dilation, joint pains, etc.) than
chlorpromazine (Thorazine<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) plus
diazepam (<A HREF="refs.html#r34">34</A>). A further study verified
this and found that adding tizanidine (an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist)
to the DXM+diazepam cocktail was even more effective (<A HREF="refs.html#r133">133</A>).</P>

<P>Dissociatives have also been found to reverse or prevent tolerance
to cocaine (<A HREF="refs.html#r247">247</A>), nicotine (<A HREF="refs.html#r249">249</A>),
and alcohol (<A HREF="refs.html#r232">232</A>), and some researchers
have suggested that DXM (and other NMDA antagonists) may be
universally useful in most if not all drug addictions.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.15.5 &nbsp; DXM for Disease and Miscellaneous
Conditions</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM is being investigated as a treatment for various diseases due
mostly to its NMDA antagonist effects. The most promising results
have been in treating shingles, a disease which primarily affects the
elderly wherein a dormant viral infection flares up and attacks
peripheral nerves. DXM can block the (often excruciating) pain from
this flareup, and may prevent peripheral nerve damage (<A HREF="refs.html#r370">370</A>).
It may also be effective at treating herpes pain (<A HREF="refs.html#r368">368</A>).</P>

<P>Some chronic neurodegenerative diseases may be treatable with DXM.
Notable among these include ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) (<A HREF="refs.html#r168">168</A>),
although more recent research seems to show that DXM may not be a
useful treatment for ALS (<A HREF="refs.html#r363">363</A>). Even
"Mad Cow" disease (and other prion diseases) may respond to treatment
with DXM (<A HREF="refs.html#r362">362</A>).</P>

<P>DXM has also been used to treat mental retardation (<A HREF="refs.html#r35">35</A>),
and Parkinson's disease (<A HREF="refs.html#r36">36</A>). DXM may
even have be useful in treating lung and other cancers (<A HREF="refs.html#r38">38</A>)
and preventing tissue rejection in transplants (<A HREF="refs.html#r263">263</A>)
due to the (poorly understood) effects of sigma ligands on tumor
cells and the immune system (see <A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10.2">Section
10.2</A>).</P>

<P>Some papers have suggested that dissociatives have antidepressant
effects (<A HREF="refs.html#r208">208</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r212">212</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r223">223</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r245">245</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r250">250</A>),
while others dispute this (<A HREF="refs.html#r225">225</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r229">229</A>).
Finally, the dissociative qualities of DXM may be of use; ketamine
has been used to calm children in order to perform genital exam in
cases of suspected sexual abuse (<A HREF="refs.html#r184">184-186</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.16.1 &nbsp; Fatal or Dangerous
Interactions</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM should not be used (either recreationally or at normal dosage
levels) by people who are taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI,
rhymes with "wowee") - either a prescription MAOI or a recreational
one such as harmaline. Note that there is considerable confusion
among drug users about what is and isn't a MAOI. MAOIs include a few
drugs prescribed for depression and Parkinson's disease, and a few
rare recreational drugs derived from exotic plant sources (harmine
and harmaline, from Syrian Rue and Yag&eacute;, for example).
Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, MDMA, cheese, beer,
Seldane<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, etc., are <B>not</B>
MAOIs - they are things to avoid when taking a MAOI. If you are
taking a prescription MAOI you will almost certainly know, as your
physician will have (hopefully!) told you to avoid eating aged
cheeses. <B> Combining DXM and a MAOI has been fatal (</B><A HREF="refs.html#r3"><B>3</B></A><B>)!</B></P>

<P>Fluoxetine (Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) is a
cytochrome P450-2D6 inhibitor (<A HREF="refs.html#r39">39</A>) and
will change the characteristics of a DXM trip somewhat, increasing
the ratio of DXM to DXO. Other P450-2D6 inhibiting drugs, which
include many antidepressants, will probably do the same; see
<A HREF="appendices.html#toc.15.1">Section 15.1</A>. The duration of
the trip may be greatly extended by P450-2D6 inhibitors; some users
have reported effects lasting 12 to 24 hours past the normal
duration. The potency of DXM may also be enhanced via other
mechanisms by fluoxetine (<A HREF="refs.html#r40">40</A>).</P>

<P>Combining DXM with the antidepressants Desyrel (trazodone) or
Serzone (nefazodone) has been reported to cause liver damage!</P>

<P>One user reported that combining DXM with bupropion
(Wellbutrin&#91;tm&#93;) resulted in a prolonged (3+ day) hangover
and an increase in adverse side effects.</P>

<P>Fluoxetine and other SSRI antidepressants, as well as tricyclics
and lithium (and of course MAOIs) may interact with DXM to cause
<B>serotonin syndrome</B> (see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.2.9">Section
6.2.9</A>). This condition, although rarely fatal, is not terribly
pleasant. Vascular disease may increase the chance for serotonin
syndrome with DXM + antidepressants (<A HREF="refs.html#r364">364</A>),
and other disease conditions may do so as well. Some DXM users who
have taken DXM while on antidepressants have reported unpleasant
reactions that sound a lot like serotonin syndrome, so you might want
to watch out. Some of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome include
muscle rigidity, confusion, diarrhea, incoordination, low-grade
fever, sweating, muscle tremor, mania, agitation, exaggerated
reflexes, and nausea.</P>

<P>Do not take DXM with the diet drugs phentermine, fenfluramine, or
phen-fen; this combination can also cause serotonin syndrome.</P>

<P>DXM should not be taken (recreationally or at normal dosage
levels) with the prescription antihistamine terfenadine
(Seldane<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>). <B> This combination
has been fatal (</B><A HREF="refs.html#r41"><B>41</B></A><B>).</B>
Terfenadine has been implicated in other drug interactions,
incidentally. The reason for this interaction seems to be that
terfenadine, which is normally metabolized by a P450 enzyme, induces
heart irregularities when it builds up. DXM may saturate the P450
enzymes that normally metabolize terfenadine. Incidentally, this
probably applies to other non-drowsy antihistamines, such as
Claritin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> and
Hisminal<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> as well; avoid combining
them with DXM.</P>

<P>Some people find that nicotine (cigarettes) causes severe nausea
when combined with DXM. Others have noticed a general increase in
physical discomfort and "bad trips" from combining the two. Some
research has suggested that cigarette smoke inhibits monoamine
oxidase (<A HREF="refs.html#r378">378</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r379">379</A>)
in which case cigarettes could greatly increase the chance of
unpleasant side effects.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.16.2 &nbsp; Beneficial Drug Interactions</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Both opiates and dissociatives have strong side effects which can
limit their usefulness in pain treatment. When the two are combined,
however, a synergistic effect occurs, and patients can lower the dose
of both drugs to the point where side effects are minimalized
(<A HREF="refs.html#r236">236</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r267">267</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r278">278</A>).
Dissociatives prevent tolerance to opiates (<A HREF="refs.html#r248">248</A>)
and can alleviate opiate withdrawal (<A HREF="refs.html#r254">254</A>).
On the other hand, combining the two may increase the chance for
respiratory depression and fatal overdose.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.16.3 &nbsp; Recreational Drug
Interactions</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Marijauna and DXM is a frequently used combination, albeit one which
has seen little research. Competitive NMDA blockade enhances
marijuana catalepsy (<A HREF="refs.html#r210">210</A>), and
conceivably noncompetitive blockade would as well. Dizocilpine, a
dissociative used in research, decreases the analgesic effects of
marijuana (<A HREF="refs.html#r214">214</A>), and causes
downregulation of anandamide receptors (THC receptors) (<A HREF="refs.html#r218">218</A>).</P>

<P>Dissociatives may block the depletion of 5HT (serotonin) caused by
MDMA (ecstasy) (<A HREF="refs.html#r241">241</A>). However, there is
also the potential for hypertensive problems, so I wouldn't advise
this combination. Methamphetamine produces vacuolation of neuron
terminals due to a collapsed vesicular proton gradient (<A HREF="refs.html#r181">181</A>)
(translated into English, this means that speed damages brain cells
by breaking open the little bubbles of neurotransmitters inside the
cells). However, dizocilpine (and presumably other dissociatives) may
prevent this (<A HREF="refs.html#r219">219</A>). It also seems to
block methamphetamine induced 5HT depletion (<A HREF="refs.html#r241">241</A>).</P>

<P>Antidepressants and dissociatives seem to interact as well, not
necessarily in a good way. Both desipramine and dissociatives
increase prefrontal lobe dopamine activity; the combination is highly
synergistic (<A HREF="refs.html#r277">277</A>). Even worse,
dissociatives may actually reverse the antidepressant effect
(<A HREF="refs.html#r229">229</A>). Dizocilpine reduces
5HT<SUB>2</SUB> receptor density (<A HREF="refs.html#r212">212</A>),
and increases 5HT binding in the hippocampus and striatum (<A HREF="refs.html#r252">252</A>).
On the other hand, one paper found that dizocilpine helped
antidepressants in some tests (<A HREF="refs.html#r245">245</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r250">250</A>).</P>

<P>Finally, dissociatives block tolerance to many drugs, including
alcohol (<A HREF="refs.html#r232">232</A>), cocaine (<A HREF="refs.html#r247">247</A>),
nicotine (<A HREF="refs.html#r249">249</A>), and morphine (<A HREF="refs.html#r248">248</A>).</P>

<H2><CENTER>4.17 &nbsp; General Warnings</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Probably the most important warning about DXM is that, like other
dissociatives, it may cause brain damage when used to excess (see
<A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.3.1">Section 6.3.1</A>. What exactly
constitutes "excess" is anyone's guess, although in animal models,
Olney's lesions (the type of brain damage caused by dissociatives)
only occur at many times the <I>anaesthetic</I> dose, which is itself
higher than the recreational dose.</P>

<P>Of the people I've interviewed who have used DXM regularly, about
1% have reported long-term cognitive impairment (although some of
these people were continuing to use DXM when they reported it, so it
may have been due to chronic intoxication rather than any permanent
damage). Everyone who did report impairment were very heavy users,
i.e.,</P>

<UL>
   <LI>720mg or more (upper plateau doses)</LI>
   
   <LI>twice per week or more often</LI>
   
   <LI>extended use over at least one year</LI>
</UL>

<P>On the other hand, many people seem to be able to use DXM very
heavily for years without adverse effects, though. So in any case,
<I>be careful!</I>.</P>

<P>Like other psychoactive drugs, DXM should not be used by people
who are mentally or emotionally unstable. I tend to believe that NO
recreational drug (legal or not) should be used unless the user is in
a calm, rational mood, free from anxiety or negative emotions, and is
in a controlled setting where s/he will not have to drive. Speaking
of which, as DXM is an intoxicating drug, don't drive under the
influence. Ever. But I shouldn't have to tell you that, right?</P>

<P>High doses of DXM can be very dissociative. While this is not
necessarily bad, you should know what you are getting into first. A
high-dose DXM trip is <EM>not </EM>like an LSD trip; it more closely
resembles ketamine. You will most likely encounter experiences that
you didn't expect, and possibly didn't want. While this is OK for the
more committed psychonaut, casual users of hallucinogens might want
to think twice before taking a high dose.</P>

<P>Prolonged use of DXM, or extended doses of DXM (including the
polistirex formulation), may cause problems due to the buildup of DXM
(as opposed to DXO), and the resulting activity at sigma receptors
(see <A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10.2">Section 10.2</A>). Sigma
receptors seem to have a potent modulatory role on neurons, possibly
inducing permanent or semi-permanent changes when they are activated
for long periods of time (most studies so far indicate over 3 days of
high DXM concentrations are required before such changes occur).
Furthermore, sigma activity seems to be correlated with delusional
thinking, which should probably be avoided, especially in the
inexperienced.</P>

<P>Some people are allergic to tartrazine (FD&amp;C Yellow #5), which
is present in several cough syrups. Sensitivity to tartrazine is
rare, but is frequent in people sensitive to aspirin. Avoid
tartrazine if you are, or think you might be, allergic to it or to
aspirin. Note that, based on anecdotal evidence, I believe that
sensitivity to other dyes may develop from chronic use.</P>

<P>The large amount of glycerine, glucose syrup, and sugars present
in cough syrups can give some people problems ranging from stomach
ache to sugar shock. Obviously anyone with diabetes or a family
history of blood sugar problems should avoid cough syrups.</P>

<P><BR>
<I>Noscapine</I> is a natural ingredient in opium, and is related to
papaverine. It doesn't seem to have any opiate-like effects (other
than cough suppression) and is not constipating. It may be a
NMDA/sigma ligand like DXM. Adverse effects and effects of overdose
include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, nausea, allergic rhinitis,
conjunctivitis, and skin rashes. I have no idea whether it has
recreational effects at high doses, but I wouldn't advise finding
out. Oral adult dose is 25mg-50mg 3-4 times daily.</P>

<P><BR>
Opiates are of course still used as cough suppressants; the most
common is codeine, which is still used for severe coughs (although
some research suggests it is no better than DXM). Other opiates have
been used for severe cough. As an interesting bit of trivia, heroin
was first marketed for cough suppression.</P>

<P>The recreational effects of opiates are fairly well known, and are
in any case beyond the scope of the DXM FAQ.</P>

<H3><CENTER>4.18.4 &nbsp; Can DXM be Detected on Drug
Tests?</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
As DXM itself, probably not; nobody bothers to look for it. There has
been some anecdotal evidence that DXM can cause false positives for
opiate tests, but one paper (<A HREF="refs.html#r374">374</A>)
disputes this. There may be more reliable evidence that DXM can cause
false positives for PCP and possibly cocaine.</P>

<P>So keep this in mind before using DXM if you have to take a drug
test. If worse comes to worse, you can always claim you had a bad
cold, and ask them to do a test which will discriminate between
opiates and DXM. Good luck!</P>
