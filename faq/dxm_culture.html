<H1><CENTER>12 &nbsp; DXM Drug Culture</CENTER></H1>

<P><BR>
This section describes some of the current and past DXM culture. Most
of this is one big unknown, and I'm attempting to write the
definitive text on the history of DXM's recreational use (this will
probably take me several years). If you have information on this
topic, especially related to the use of DXM in the form of
Romilar<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> prior to 1975, please
contact me.</P>

<H2><CENTER>12.1 &nbsp; Is There, or Was There, a DXM Drug
Culture?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The answer is an overwhelming yes, although DXM use has always been
deeply underground. For example, in the late 1980's, DXM was widely
popular with the hardcore/punk movement, and in the 1970's, there
seemed to be other groups of users. DXM users in the late 1980's, and
possibly in other times, had a sort of "network" that stretched
across the USA and into parts of Europe. The total number of users
was probably less than 10,000. An interesting characteristic of their
DXM use was that it was a group activity, whereas many DXM users
today regard it as a solitary experience.</P>

<P>There seem to be (rare) medical references indicating DXM
recreational abuse dating back to the 1960's. I'm trying to get more
on this. I have talked to a few people who have said that
recreational use of DXM in the form of
Romilar<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> tablets was extremely
common. If so, then DXM's recreational potential may be the best-kept
secret in the recreational drug world.</P>

<P>Some cities seemed to have considerable DXM use activity, notably
with youth; in one town, there were empty bottles of cough syrup
littering the street, and sale of cough syrups were restricted to
people 18 and up. However, these incidents seem to be few and far
between.</P>

<H3><CENTER>12.1.1 &nbsp; DXM in the 1960's</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Romilar<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> was released in the US in
as a non-narcotic cough suppressant to replace codeine, which was
already being used recreationally. Although there is no evidence of
this, I would assume that people who were familiar with codeine's
recreational potential decided to try to "overdose" on the new
product and see if it had potential.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I have received a few letters from people who were involved with
the drug culture of the late Beatnik era, and who used DXM. Most
seemed to consider it something to use when better drugs (primarily
opiates, although eventually LSD) were unavailable. A few, however,
preferred DXM, and eventually its reputation as a recreational drug
led to Romilar<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> tablets being
taken off the market in the US.</P>

<P>It appears that nobody formal studies of recreational DXM use were
published during its use, which many people have told me was
widespread. A few who knew about its potential then have told me that
the medical community was neither educated about, nor particularly
interested in, DXM; there were larger drug problems to confront.
Furthermore, drug use was still isolated to minorities and social
outcasts, and most white Americans regarded the Beatniks as the
latter. Remember, this was before drug use had become popular among
the youth counterculture of the later 1960's and 1970's.</P>

<P>I am still looking for information about DXM use during this time,
but I suspect it will be several years before I can make any
sophisticated analysis of the phenomenon.</P>

<H3><CENTER>12.1.2 &nbsp; DXM in the 1970's</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM-containing cough syrups replaced
Romilar<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> in the 1970's, and its
use declined as most people were unwilling to drink a bottle of cough
syrup to get high. Besides, in the late 1960's and 1970's, LSD,
peyote, and a limited number of other psychedelics were widely
available. Those who liked DXM probably turned to these, and
eventually to PCP when it became available.</P>

<P>There doesn't seem to have been any particular subculture
associated with DXM in the 1970's. Some of its users were ordinary
people who enjoyed lower plateau experiences. From letters I have
received, this has ranged from young drug enthusiasts to bored
housewives. A fair number of Vietnam veterans evidently used DXM
overseas and continued using it when they returned.</P>

<H3><CENTER>12.1.3 &nbsp; DXM in the 1980's</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
I have considerably more information about the use of DXM in the
1980's. With the backlash against the drug culture of the 1970's and
1960's, and especially the accelerating War on Drugs, psychedelics
became generally less available, especially in rural areas or smaller
towns. There seem to have been clusters of DXM users, many (but not
all) in rural or small urban areas, isolated in location or by
subculture. I have the most data on DXM use among the hardcore punk
culture of the late 1980's.</P>

<H3><CENTER>12.1.3.1 &nbsp; DXM in the Hardcore Punk
Community</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
I don't know who among the hardcore punks first thought of drinking a
bottle of cough syrup for fun, although conversations with former
residents of punk warehouses has given me some ideas. In one case,
the user's father had used DXM during the Vietnam war, and continued
to use it when he returned (and in fact his wife had divorced him
because of DXM). In another case the brief mention of DXM in the
Anarchist's Cookbook started the individual on DXM use. Once people
were familiar with its use, it spread widely among the community. It
does not seem to have spread far beyond it, possibly because the
entire community prided itself on isolation from the general culture
which it viewed as socially deranged.</P>

<P>Someone somewhere must have done some medical research, because
the community generally understood which preparations were safe and
which were not. It certainly wasn't from the Anarchist's Cookbook,
which is in general full of mistakes, misinformation, and lacking in
safety precautions; some have even gone so far as to suggest that it
was put out by the government in an attempt to get would-be
anarchists to blow themselves up.</P>

<P>Robitussin DM<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> and generic
equivalents, then containing 3mg/ml of DXM, were the preparations of
choice. Rarely people would return from foreign countries with
tablets (especially Contac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>
tablets from Canada). The typical dose was 4oz (360mg), 8oz (720mg),
or 12oz (1080mg).</P>

<P>People among the subculture would use DXM primarily in group
environments, at people's houses and in the warehouses where many of
them lived. Often a theme was chosen for the DXM trip (although the
term "vacation" was sometimes preferred to "trip"). Themes included
locations, historic times, fantasy environments, emotions, and
abstract concepts. DXM was almost never a solitary activity.</P>

<P>Not everyone in the subculture used DXM; some preferred other
drugs, some were totally straightedge (drug-free). Nearly all seemed
tolerant and even accepting of an individual's choice to use or not
use a particular drug (except in the case of heroin and cocaine,
which were shunned, at least among the people who have contacted me).
Among those who used DXM, it was often a part of the sense of
membership in the community.</P>

<P>Some have told me that DXM use was already beginning to decline
before the subculture itself fell apart (due to a variety of factors
including the rise of neo-Nazi skinheads, increasing violence, and
the maturation and reintegration of its members into society). Some
simply became tired of drinking cough syrup to get high, and noted
increasing nausea and side effects, and decreasing pleasure, with its
use. However, in a few cases DXM developed a bad reputation as
individuals had problems with the drug.</P>

<P>DXM addiction seems to be isolated to particular individuals, and
it is not known whether susceptibility is due to genetic factors,
psychology, environment, use patterns, or other factors. However,
rumors of suicides among chronic DXM users began to circulate, and
many people were unwilling to use a drug which might lead to
depression, addiction, and suicide. To what degree these rumors were
true, I do not know, although I do have reliable evidence of at least
one suicide attempt by an individual who became addicted to DXM and
used it daily.</P>

<P>Because daily users often retreat from their social environment,
they were often viewed as valuing the drug above their social
network. Since use of the drug among most was intimately integrated
into the social network, this isolation was an indicator that DXM may
have a serious darker side. In a community that prides itself on its
social cohesiveness, anything which threatens that is bad news.</P>

<P>In any case, the subculture eventually deteriorated, although to
some degree there are (typically isolated) elements of it remaining.
One example is provided in (<A HREF="refs.html#r377">377</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>12.1.3.2 &nbsp; DXM in Other Subcultures</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Sometimes DXM spread throughout an entire community. I have been told
of a few small towns throughout the US where DXM was widely used
among the high-school and early college youth. In one case, according
to a former user, empty cough syrup bottles literally littered the
streets. Utah was evidently particularly hard-hit by teenage DXM use.
More than one former user has told me that DXM was primarily popular
where there was nothing else to do. Most communities effectively
solved this problem by placing DXM behind the counter, and requiring
proof of age before allowing purchases.</P>

<H3><CENTER>12.1.4 &nbsp; DXM in the 1990's</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
During the early 1990's DXM remained isolated to subcultures
according to users. It would sometimes spread among a group of
friends, but never far beyond that. However, the increasing reach of
the Internet, especially among college students, is totally changing
the face of DXM use.</P>

<P>This change started before the FAQ was published, and I have no
doubt that it would have occurred whether or not I had chosen to
publish the FAQ. There are numerous Usenet newsgroups dedicated to
discussion of drugs, and people who were familiar with DXM were eager
to discuss it and point out its good qualities (unfortunately, many
neglected to bring up safety precautions and side effects).</P>

<P>The Usenet drugs newsgroups were initially poorly distributed and
its members formed a somewhat isolated community consisting of drug
enthusiasts, psychonauts, former drug users, and the curious.
However, as the Internet expanded beyond the domain of computer users
and professionals, many college students began to investiage these
drug newsgroups (and, later, the numerous drug-related webpages).</P>

<P>Numerous undergraduate students have told me that their interest
in drugs started when they discovered that marijuana wasn't the evil
demon-weed as they were taught, and that their brains didn't turn
into fried eggs from smoking it. Nor did it take over their lives, as
most who used marijuana maintained their grades, and restricted its
use to weekends. If I had to make a generalization I would say that
college marijuana users may be a lot more responsible with their drug
use than college alcohol users.</P>

<P>I don't believe in the "gateway" theory that marijauna use leads
to use of other drugs. Instead, I think that it is the propaganda
about marijuana that leads to experimentation with other drugs.
People don't enjoy being lied to, and anyone with two hours of free
time and the barest of scientific knowledge can go pick up medical
journals and learn that marijuana is one of the safest recreational
drugs known to man. Many have told me that once they knew they'd been
lied to about marijuana, they were curious to see if other drugs
weren't the evil chemicals they'd been portrayed as.</P>

<P>Thankfully, most seemed to confine their experimentation to
psychedelics, including mushrooms, LSD, MDMA (ecstasy), DMT, 2CB, and
others. Since these drugs induce profound and often puzzling
experiences, users would turn to the Internet to find experienced
users, discuss how to use them best, what to do under the influence,
philosophies of the Universe, and so on. So it was inevitable I
believe that DXM would become known among college students, at least
among those who used illegal drugs.</P>

<P>Currently, as I write this, the FAQ has become the definitive
source of information about DXM among users on the Internet. However,
the spread of DXM use still seems to occur through networks of
friends and those who share common interests. What the Internet has
done is to transcend geography and allow people around the world to
share their interests and knowledge, and provide a mechanism for the
near-instantaneous spread of new interests and ideas.</P>

<P>This is in my opinion an undeniable good. You can now find an FAQ
about most any drug, and most of them are well-written and discuss
both the good and the bad sides of drugs. Often current and former
users make well-presented cases for why <I>not</I> to use the drug.
As an example, most heroin users are extremely critical of the
media's attention to, and glamorization of, the drug, and will
actively discourage people curious about it from taking it.
Psychedelic enthusiasts are often equally discouraging of people who
wish to use psychedelics but are not emotionally and mentally
prepared.</P>

<P>However, it is inevitable that whenever a taboo subject is brought
out into the open, the curious will try it. This is why I wrote the
FAQ in the first place, to give the curious a good look at the good
and bad sides of the drug.</P>

<H3><CENTER>12.1.5 &nbsp; The Future of DXM Use</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
I believe a sort of threshold has been passed in that DXM use has now
entered the mainstream of drug users. I suspect its use will continue
to rise until either it is taken off the market, or it reaches a
natural plateau. DXM is not, in my opinion, addictive enough to
explode into popularity like cocaine, amphetamines, and heroin;
instead, I suspect that, like most psychedelics, it will be popular
among a limited number of people who will use it for a year or two
and then stop. Fortunately DXM use does seem to be self-limiting, as
the pleasurable aspects of its use decline and annoying but harmless
side effects increase with time.</P>

<P>I don't think DXM will be taken off the market entirely; instead,
it will probably be restricted to preparations containing other
ingredients. My guess is that guaifenesin will be used, since it
induces nausea with overdose. There will still be DXM enthusiasts
willing to tough out the nausea, but most people, I think, will be
unwilling to repeat the experience and unwilling to suggest it to
others. The worst possible response, in my opinion, would be to add
acetaminophen; while it would stop DXM use, it may do so at the
expense of numerous deaths.</P>

<P>My greatest fear is that some "pop news" show will become aware of
DXM and decide to do a feature on it. I have no desire to bring
awareness of DXM to the overall public; I suspect that teenagers
across the country, looking for a cheap buzz, would rush down to
their nearest drugstore, buy a bottle of cough syrup, and take it
without adequate knowledge of dosage, drug interactions, or side
effects. DXM would probably be pulled from the market, and people
with an actual need for it would be worse off. While many DXM users
would of course stop using it, some would probably turn to ketamine
or (even worse) PCP, attempt to find DXM "on the street", or find
worse drugs to use.</P>

<P>If you really want to limit the use of DXM, the best response
would be to consider those who are using it casually. Serious
psychonauts are not, in general, using DXM on a regular basis, or if
they are, they are at least aware of the risks. However, many young
people who use DXM are simply looking for a cheap high. There are
very few drugs which provide a cheap high and carry a low risk; the
safest among these is marijuana. And more than one young person has
told me they have used DXM because marijuana is illegal. You can draw
your own conclusions.</P>

<H2><CENTER>12.2 &nbsp; Why Haven't I Heard About DXM Drug
Culture?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
There are, I think, four factors which have combined to keep DXM out
of the public eye and limited to subcultures:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Only about 1/3 of people who try DXM enjoy the experience
   enough to repeat it.</LI>
   
   <LI>The public is unaware of DXM, and most people are skeptical of
   the idea of getting high off cough syrup.</LI>
   
   <LI>Many people who traditionally use DXM do not, in general,
   discuss their use outside of their social group or clique.</LI>
   
   <LI>Medical authorities are either ignorant of DXM or unwilling to
   discuss it, either professionally or with the general public.</LI>
</OL>

<P>As a consequence, when someone uses DXM and does enjoy it, and
tells his or her friends, many will dismiss the idea, and among those
who try it, most won't repeat the experience. In tightly-knit social
groups, both clusters of friends and larger subcultures, DXM use may
expand to saturate the group (and involve from 30% to 60% of the
group, as near as I can tell with my limited data). However, members
outside of these cliques and groups do not typically hear about DXM,
or if they do, they aren't willing to try it on the suggestion of
someone who is obviously outside the social norm.</P>

<P>As far as the silence of medical authorities goes, my hunch is
that at some point (probably when Romilar became popular as a
recreational drug) the medical authorities and manufacturers of
DXM-based preparations realized that they had two choices: take DXM
off the market, or convince people they couldn't get high off of it.
They took the latter approach, getting rid of DXM-only pills and
leaving cough medicines in which DXM was combined with other
ingredients. The majority of users decided it wasn't worth the effort
of gulping down cough syrup (and possibly vomiting due to
guaifenesin), and the public remained ignorant.</P>

DXM doesn't have a drug slang like most other drugs, since its use
has never been widespread. Instead, particular groups of users will

<H3><CENTER>12.3.1 &nbsp; Non-American DXM Drug Slang</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
I have a little bit of information on (modern) drug slang in Germany.
Please forgive (and make me aware of) any typoes. The following
phrases are, according to one person, used among his group of DXM
users. "Rentschler" refers to the manufacturer of the DXM capsule
brand <I>tuss hustenstiller retard kapseln</I>.</P>

<UL>
   <LI><I>Na, hast du mal wieder getusst?</I><BR>
   "So, have you tussed the last time"?</LI>
   
   <LI><I>Warst Du mal wieder auf Rentschler?</I><BR>
   "Have you been on Rentschler again?"</LI>
   
   <LI><I>Hast du gestern wieder gerentschlert?</I><BR>
   "Have you Rentschlered yesterday?"</LI>
</UL>

<P>Other German DXM users refer to DXM As "Mega-Perls" (see
above).</P>

<P>Good question. Lots of people consider DXM to be a "second-class"
drug, good only for people who can't get the real thing. Here's some
things to try and point out: <TABLE>

      <TD>
         <P>DXM is in the same drug class as PCP and ketamine
         ("Vitamin K" or "Special-K"), with an added stimulant effect
         functioning like that of Ritalin or cocaine. Oh goodie!</P>

         <P>DXM's recreational use potential has probably been
         purposefully hidden by the medical community. So not only do
         you get a drug, you also get conspiracy theory material as
         well!</P>
