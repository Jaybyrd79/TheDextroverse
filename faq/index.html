Dextromethorphan, Preliminary statements, disclaimers, introductions.

<HR>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">The DXM FAQ does not reflect the views of
FrogNet. Inc</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Recently one of the users on FrogNet, the ISP who
provides space for this &#91;original&#93; webpage, has objected to
its content. I would like to take a moment to address this
individual's objections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">First off, let me briefly explain the FAQ and its
positions. The FAQ was written in response to dangerous
misinformation about DXM being presented on the net at the time. Many
of the suggestions then offered for its use could be harmful or
fatal. I collected information, spent over two hundred hours of
research, and presented the FAQ as a way to combat the potential
misinformation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I have had hundreds of responses, ranging from
former and current users of DXM, to family physicians,
neuropharmacologists, educators, and other professionals. All but
<B>one</B> (an individual without medical or scientific knowledge)
were pleased with the FAQ and stated that it was a responsible paper
concerning the subject. Furthermore, I am constantly rewriting the
FAQ to keep up with current medical knowledge, and personally I do
<B>not</B> advocate DXM use (in fact, I don't even think it's such a
good idea, especially if you aren't prepared).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The views of this paper do not reflect FrogNet
Inc.'s. However, one view that I hold is that
censorship based on content is morally wrong so long as nobody was
forcibly included in the formation of that content. FrogNet's and E
System's policies are that they will not censor based on content
unless legally required to do so. Once censorship on content starts,
it is all too easy to respond in kind, and sooner or later there is
nothing left to censor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Recreational drug use is a volatile topic (as is
pornography). What most people don't realize, however, is that they
too are recreational drug users, and that the drugs they choose
(alcohol and tobacco in particular) are far more deadly than any
illegal drug. Alcohol is one of the only drugs whose use is directly
toxic to the body and brain, and which creates a tolerance condition
where withdrawal can be equally deadly. Tobacco and alcohol each kill
more people than all other drugs combined (legal or not).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">There have been very few deaths due to DXM. Of
these, one was an intentional suicide, and all the others involve
contraindiciations and drug-drug interactions which are specifically
addressed in the FAQ. Furthermore, all of these occurred prior to the
publishing of the FAQ.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Finally, I'd like to point out again that the FAQ
has been positively reviewed by professionals in the medical and
scientific communities. These people seem to think it is, for the
most part, responsible, and I have made every effort to address
specific concerns. If you believe otherwise, please take a moment to
consider that your moral outrage may have causes other than logical
and scientific. You may simply be blinded by beliefs which you hold
dear yet which have no basis in fact.</FONT></P></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="#000000">New Section: Moron of the
Moment</FONT></CENTER></H2>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Since first coming up with
the FAQ I've received a grand total of four negative responses out of
over eight hundred total. Recently I got one with no return address
(funny, that); because of this, I can't respond to him/her directly.
However, I <I>can</I> take the comments and deconstruct them
(besides, s/he marked them public anyway). So, if you'd like to take
a look at my first negative comment in over six months, and the
response I'd give to it, go </FONT><A HREF="http://www.frognet.net/~dxm/deconstruct.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">here</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">.
</FONT></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="#000000">New Section on Quitting
DXM</FONT></CENTER></H2>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">If you find yourself
psychologically addicted to DXM you may wish to consult the new
section on quitting DXM (</FONT><A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.8"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Section
6.8</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">). Remember, I'm not a
doctor and I'm not going to play one on the net either, so see a
physician first and foremost and ask her or him about the suggestions
I list from former DXM addicts. </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Introduction to the FAQ
v4.0</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">A lot has happened since I
published Version 3 of the DXM FAQ; some of it has been good, some
not so good. I'd like to take a moment to address some of these
changes and some of my concerns. I still do not regret having
published the FAQ, and out of all the feedback I have received
(including letters from physicians, scientists, parents, and just
plain druggies), less than one percent has been negative. The reasons
I gave for its publication still apply, but those of you familiar
with v3.0 will notice that this version shows considerably less
praise for DXM. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">When I published the FAQ on Usenet
(and then the World Wide Web), it was my expectation that it would be
of interest primarily to psychonauts, experienced psychedelic users,
and others who use drugs for self-exploration and spiritual purposes.
I knew, of course, that not everyone who did DXM would use it with
the intention of expanding the mind, but I reasoned that, given the
relative unpleasantness of consuming cough syrup, and the "heaviness"
of the DXM experience, most people would find casual, recreational
use of DXM unlikely. Things didn't quite turn out how I expected.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Also at that time there was a
severe shortage of information from former DXM users about adverse
effects of long-term use. I had reasoned that long-term use was
probably not a good idea, but probably not terribly dangerous. Of the
people I had interviewed who had used DXM regularly, very few had any
problem with it, and those who did recovered when they stopped using
it. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Since then there has been a great
increase in DXM use (or at least more people are talking about it).
My concern that the FAQ had started a "DXM epidemic" turned out to be
mostly baseless; the majority of new DXM users seem to hear about it
the same way that DXM users have always learned about it: from their
friends. Some do learn about it from the FAQ, but for the most part
you have to know about DXM in the first place before finding or
understanding the FAQ. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">As I have spoken to more and more
users of DXM, I have learned that more people have negative
experiences with the drug than I had expected. Most of these are
simply people who try it once, decide they don't like it, and never
try it again. A few people, on the other hand, seem to be greatly
susceptible to DXM addiction and some of these have suffered
long-term health consequences. A very few may have suffered permanent
brain damage from extremely heavy use of DXM (e.g., an 8oz bottle of
Maximum Strength syrup every day). On the other hand, some people
consume the same amount for years seemingly without consequence. And
while some people can consume DXM regularly without psychological
consequences, others suffer from severe depression and psychotic
breaks, even leading to a few cases of suicide attempts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">This brings me to the most
relevant new information about DXM: Olney's findings of NMDA
Antagonist Neurotoxicity (NAN). There is great debate right now
whether NAN is relevant at recreational doses or not. In animals, the
dosage required to induce NAN is far in excess of the anaesthetic
dose, and humans typically take sub-anaesthetic doses of
dissociatives. On the other hand, there may be danger with long-term
use at considerably lower dosages that the animal models do not show.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">The data from human experiences
are hard to interpret. Many heavy PCP users suffer obvious cognitive
and motor impairment; however, PCP has neurotoxic effects (in
particular in the cerebellum) not shared by other dissociatives
including DXM or ketamine. Ketamine is probably a better
approximation of DXM, but very few people have done large amounts of
ketamine for long periods of time. A notable exception is John Lilly,
who is a bit of a nut, but was probably a bit of a nut before doing
ketamine, and (at least the last time I checked) he doesn't seem to
suffer from cognitive impairment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">There are a few DXM users who have
suffered long-term consequences. Out of approximately five hundred
current and former DXM users I have heard from, three have suffered
lasting cognitive impairment. Additionally, there is one published
paper on cognitive impairment from chronic DXM use, although the
author suggests an underlying temporal lobe seizure disorder. DXM has
been shown to increase the frequency of complex partial seizures, and
it's possible that it is the seizures, and not the DXM itself, which
is causing problems. Unfortunately, it has also been suggested
temporal lobe epileptics may also be more susceptible to dissociative
addiction. Hopefully much of this will be resolved in the next few
years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Until then, my official
recommendation is not to use DXM at all. Since I know this isn't
likely to happen, my own personal belief is that DXM is probably
pretty safe when used occasionally (e.g., once or twice a month) at
the lower plateaus, and rarely (e.g., once or twice a year) at the
higher plateaus. I have yet to hear from anyone who used DXM with
this or less frequency who has suffered any impairment, temporary or
permanent. Actually, to be technically correct, nobody using it once
a week for less than six months has ever seemed to have problems, but
it's always best to keep a wide safety margin. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Another thing to keep in mind is
that DXM in the upper plateaus is a considerably different experience
than the lower plateaus, and may be better suited to spiritual or
ritual use. Even at the lower plateaus, DXM is not really well suited
as a frequent recreational drug. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">So what do you do then if you find
yourself in that particularly human condition of ennui (for which
psychedelics are a most effective medicine)? Well, ideally I'd
suggest you hop on a plane to Amsterdam (or somewhere else where 2CB
and marijuana are legal). Unfortunately this isn't an ideal world,
and flying across the Atlantic is outside the means of most of us
(including me). A more reasonable suggestion would be to do your part
to change the laws in this country so that psychedelics can regain
their rightful place as tools for mental, emotional, and spiritual
exploration and growth. Remember, the laws aren't going to change
unless we work to change them. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">In summary, I'm not nearly as
convinced that DXM is a benevolent psychedelic as I used to be. It is
in many ways considerably more powerful (and certainly more
dangerous) than LSD or mushrooms. Like all psychedelics it can
profoundly change you; unlike others, these changes are not
necessarily under your control, especially if you are not very
familiar with yourself. DXM can be a great tool for spiritual
rebirth, but it can also turn you into a paranoid, antisocial
asshole. I still believe that DXM has a place among psychedelics, but
do understand that it is <I>not</I> a replacement for LSD, mushrooms,
2CB, or even ketamine. It is a unique and uniquely powerful
mind-altering drug, and one which I think most people would do best
to avoid. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Introduction to the FAQ
v3.0</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;This document is a FAQ
("fack"), i.e., a series of questions and answers. The term comes
from Usenet, and stands for <B><U>F</U></B>requently
<B><U>A</U></B>sked <B><U>Q</U></B>uestions. These are the sorts of
questions that people new to Usenet tend to ask frequently. When
these questions become frequent enough, the question and its answer
may be placed into the FAQ for the newsgroup (or for a topic within
the newsgroup). A few people use the term AFAQ (<B><U>A</U></B>nswers
to <B><U>F</U></B>requently <B><U>A</U></B>sked
<B><U>Q</U></B>uestions), but most use FAQ to refer both to a
frequent question and to the document </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">This FAQ covers
<I>dextromethorphan</I> (decks-tro-meth-OR-fan), the cough
suppressant commonly found in cough medicines available
over-the-counter in the USA and other parts of the world. Of course,
dextromethorphan (DXM) does more than suppress coughs; otherwise,
there wouldn't be so much discussion about it on Usenet. The bizarre
truth about DXM is that it is a very potent psychoactive drug when
taken in sufficient quantities. So if you've ever heard about people
drinking cough syrup for fun, well, now you know why. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">The trouble, however, is that most
cough medicines have other ingredients which can make you
uncomfortable, sick, or dead, depending on the ingredient and how
much you take. Furthermore, even when pure, chronic or heavy use of
DXM may cause health problems. This document is intended to combat
potentially dangerous misinformation about the recreational use of
DXM, and to allow you to make an intelligent and informed decision
about DXM. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">My own interest in DXM came quite
by accident; once, while sick with the flu, I misread the
instructions on a bottle of cough syrup and drank two shots from the
included shotglass instead of two teaspoons. Soon after I noticed
that music and motion had become very satisfying experiences. This
left me puzzled, and my reaction was to go to the library and
research DXM through Medline, medical journals, and books.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Of course at that point I was
hooked - not on DXM, but on neuropharmacology. I decided to learn as
much as I could about DXM, and found it to be one of the most unique
and interesting of all recreational drugs in terms of how it works on
the brain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">About this time I noticed a number
of incorrect and potentially dangerous posts (articles) about DXM
appearing on <I>alt.drugs</I>. So, I decided to gather the
information I had and write a FAQ. It eventually became much more
than a FAQ, giving explanations and information in addition to
answers, but by then the name had stuck. The FAQ took me over 150
hours to complete - I figured if I'm going to do it, I'd better do it
right. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">After publishing the DXM FAQ, the
reports of DXM use started coming in. People who had been using DXM
but were uncomfortable talking about "getting high off cough syrup"
shared their stories with me. Some were good, some were bad, some
indifferent. I've been trying my best to get all of these personal
reports together into a coherent whole, but this FAQ is written in my
free time and I don't get paid for it (although donations are
acceptable :^). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Please note that it is
<STRONG>not</STRONG> my intention to get a bunch of people hooked on
cough syrup (actually addiction is very rare, but you get my point).
It <STRONG>is</STRONG> my intention for people to know the truth so
they don't make bad decisions for lack of knowledge. DXM is
<STRONG>not</STRONG> safe and harmless; nothing is. Nor is it
universally enjoyable; in fact, some find high-dose DXM experiences
terrifying. But I believe that people can only make good decisions,
or learn from bad decisions, if information is available. So please,
use your head! </FONT></P></CENTER>
