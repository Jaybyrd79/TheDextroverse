<H1><CENTER>5 &nbsp; The DXM Experience</CENTER></H1>

<P><BR>
This section discusses some of the effects you might expect to feel
if you were to use DXM recreationally (which I recommend against, of
course). The effects listed are generally positive, and reflect the
results of people who have positive experiences with DXM.</P>

<P><B>Some people have negative experiences with DXM!</B> For these
people, the DXM "trip" may just be several hours of dizziness,
nausea, hot flashes, and confusion, with several days of hangover.
This is the main reason why most DXM users suggest starting with a
first plateau dose.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.1 &nbsp; What is the General Character of the DXM
Experience?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
This is a difficult question to answer, because DXM's effects tend to
vary widely depending on the person, their set and setting, other
drugs, their physiology, and so on. DXM, probably more than most
drugs, tends to exert its (recreational) effects in separate stages
or "plateaus", rather than being linearly dose-dependent. Within a
given plateau, a given set of effects will occur (at a roughly
dose-dependent strength). On the other hand, once the next plateau is
reached, the feeling may change entirely. A reasonable analogy is
water - it exists in three states (solid, liquid, and gas) which all
can exist at varying temperatures (e.g., hot water and cold water),
but which have different characteristics.</P>

<P>DXM and its metabolite, dextrorphan (DXO), produce different sets
of effects. Normally, DXM is converted mostly or entirely into DXO,
but with recreational doses, the conversion enzyme (P450-2D6) may
saturate, leaving a mixture of DXM and DXO. Furthermore, another of
DXM's metabolites - 3-methoxymorphinan - can also block this enzyme,
so that taking divided doses leads to more DXM and less DXO than
taking a combined dose of the same amount.</P>

<P>DXM's effects are in some ways much more subtle than DXO's.
Whereas DXO produces a heavy "stoning" or intoxicating effect, DXM by
itself is only lightly intoxicating. DXM, however, can alter the
thought processes, leading to highly abnormal, psychosis-like mental
states. It is possible that DXM, via sigma activation, may induce a
mental state similar to that of schizophrenia. Whether or not this is
fun to you is, of course, up to you.</P>

<P>DXM seems to exhibit at least four definable plateaus based solely
on dosage, and an additional plateau is notable from a specific
dosing regimen (see below, <A HREF="#toc.5.9">Section 5.9</A>). I
previously listed three plateaus; then four; now I'm listing five
(although "Plateau Sigma" doesn't occur at dosages higher than the
fourth plateau). Evidently, dosages above the fourth plateau lead to
full anaesthesia, psychosis, coma, and/or death.</P>

<P>Not everyone notes distinction between the first and second
plateaus, or between the third and fourth plateaus. Others suggest
that each effect of DXM has a dosage level at which it starts, and
(in some cases) a dosage level at which its effects are no longer
noticeable (being overpowered by other effects). Some people will
disagree with this classification method, but I think this is the
best way to represent DXM's effects. Both the third and fourth
plateaus have significant dissociative characteristics, much like
ketamine.</P>

<P>The most important thing to keep in mind is that the effects in
different plateaus are often very different. For example, on the
first plateau, DXM tends to have a stimulant effect. Upon reaching
the second plateau, however, the stimulant effect may no longer be
present.</P>

<P>The beginning of the comedown off of a DXM trip can come abruptly.
Often, the user will know when it's starting to end by noticing the
return of normal sensory processing. Coming down from there may take
a significant amount of time. A second DXM trip too soon after coming
down is not a good idea due to the potential for side effects and
psychotic episodes (<A HREF="refs.html#r227">227</A>). Wait at least
three days and preferrably two weeks between each DXM trip.</P>

<P>The following table can be used as a general guideline for the
plateaus. For convenience I give example dosages in gelcaps and
3mg/ml syrup for 75kg and 150lb adults; adjust up or down by the
amounts indicated per 10kg or 25lb. Calculating with the mg/kg is
more accurate, but it's easy to make mistakes when using non-metric
measures. <B>These dosages are as DXM hydrobromide</B>.</P>

<P>Dosage will vary considerably from person to person, by as much as
5 times! Also, these mg/kg figures should evidently be adjusted down
for higher mass (e.g., maybe 6mg/kg to 13mg/kg third plateau for a
150kg adult). Note that kg = pounds * 0.45.</P>

<P>I have included a new category in this table: "Usenet
Suggestions". This is a combination of suggested dosage guidelines
from Usenet, and may more accurately represent the plateau dosage of
DXM in regular users (the original plateau levels were based mostly
on occasional users).</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.2 &nbsp; Overview of the Lower Plateaus</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The four dosage plateaus can be divided into two groups based on a
certain degree of similarity: the lower plateaus and the upper
plateaus. The lower two plateaus share many features and some of
these will be considered here. A generalization would be that the
lower two plateaus are more "recreational" than the upper plateaus.
Specifically, they have considerably less hangover, do not generally
involve serious disruption or breakdown of sensory processing, and
are more similar to other intoxicants.</P>

<P>DXM in the lower two plateaus has been compared to a cross between
MDA and alcohol. It tends to intensify emotional responses and
feelings of meaning from external events. At the lower plateaus there
is usually enough motor control to be able to engage in physical
activites (although, like MDMA and MDA there are reasons why you may
not want to, including dehydration and overheating).</P>

<P>Most find sensory input is still understandable, although there
are peculiar changes which will be discussed below (notably
flanging). At the lower plateaus it is still possible to interact
extensively with the outside world, and one can watch and follow
reasonably complex plots in movies, and have complex
conversations.</P>

<P>Although DXM is in many ways not a good "casual" drug most people
have used it without adverse effect at the lower plateaus.
Interestingly, many people who have use DXM at the upper plateaus
eventually find that the lower plateaus no longer offer much
enjoyment. There are a lot of potential reasons for this (see
<A HREF="dxm_most.html#toc.7.6">Section 7.6</A>); I think most of it
is simply that DXM at the upper plateaus changes one's expectations
about its effects and gives one familiarity with its memory
inhibition.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.3 &nbsp; The First Plateau</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The first plateau generally occurs around 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg (some net
users suggest 2.7mg/kg as ideal for regular users), but this may vary
enormously depending on metabolism and other factors. The first
plateau is probably the hardest to hit; many people "overshoot" it.
Please keep in mind that these effects listed are general effects,
and that individual results may vary considerably.</P>

<P>A general narrative of the first plateau can be constructed. At
about 30 minutes to 1 hour after dosing, an "alert" sensation is
noticeable; this is simply a feeling that is unique for individual
and signals the begin of altered consciousness. The experience has
only a vaguely "drug-like" character for about 10 minutes, after
which restlessness and slight stimulant effect are noticeable. After
another 10 minutes or so, movement and position sense are altered;
those with motion sickness begin to notice nausea. Gravity starts to
feel weird, and one may bounce around a lot. Emotions may start to
become intensified. There is a slight feeling of dissociation from
reality, but overall the experience is slightly intoxicating, with
intensified emotions and sense of importance from everyday events.
This effect peaks and then slowly subsides until it is
unnoticeable.</P>

<P>A first plateau trip usually takes between 20 and 40 minutes to
start (on an empty stomach), peaks about 1.5 to 2 hours later, and
lasts between 4 and 6 hours. Gel capsules take up to 1 hour
additional to dissolve. Hangovers are very rare from this plateau,
but if they do occur, they tend to consist mainly of lethargy.</P>

<P>The primary effects of the first plateau are general euphoria,
euphoria specifically linked to music and motion, slight disturbances
in balance, moderate stimulation, and very slight intoxication. The
intoxication and balance disturbances are similar to that induced by
alcohol, but much weaker and without the mental confusion; there is
little if any mental sluggishness or confusion with a first plateau
trip.</P>

<P>Some people have difficulty hitting the first plateau. It can take
several trials; as a general guideline, if you notice double vision,
you've gone way too far. A lot of the more pleasurable first plateau
effects, in particular the music euphoria, are set and setting
dependent. Being in good physical condition, avoiding excessive
caffeine, and being in a good mood are all important factors in
achieving a good first plateau dose.</P>

<P>Positive first plateau experiences are one of the first to go with
regular use. Part of this seems to be tolerance (which builds quickly
and lasts for considerable time). Another part seems to be a
familiarity with the first plateau experience; after awhile it no
longer seems quite so profound or interesting. Some have suggested
changing set and setting as a way of regaining the more interesting
aspects of the first plateau.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.5.3.1"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>5.3.1 &nbsp; Sensory Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Most of the effects of the first plateau relate to the senses. The
best known, and probably the most responsible for first plateau use
of DXM, is the effect upon hearing (specifically upon music). Sounds
may seem "richer" or "deeper", and music in particular is affected
(the difference between listening to music on DXM versus sober has
been compared to the difference between music in a concert hall
versus on a cheap radio). In addition to the change in the nature of
hearing itself, music can bring a sense of euphoria, often quite
intense. In comparison to the positive effects on music reported by
some users of cannabis, the DXM music effect is usually characterized
as much "speedier".</P>

<P>The type of music with which this effect most strongly occurs will
tend to vary from person to person. Rave music is one of the most
commonly affected, possibly due to the regular beat (at higher
plateaus especially, much of DXM's sensory effects seem beat or
rhythm related). Classical and Celtic/folk also seems to be popular.
Really, though, the strongest indicator of personal response to a
given piece of music seems to be 1) that the user enjoys it, and 2)
that it has an "intense" or thematic quality.</P>

<P>Not everyone notices this effect. Some notice the opposite -- DXM
makes music seem less impacting, and bass tends to be attenuated,
leaving everything sounding "tinny" and distant. There does not seem
to be any factor predicting whether DXM will improve or degrade the
musical experience.</P>

<P>Visual effects are not particularly strong at this plateau. If
present, they usually consist of motion trails (as if afterimages of
each "frame" of vision were not clearing quickly enough). There may
be some deterioration of stereoscopic vision (and thus depth
perception). Colors may seem slightly more vivid. Some have remarked
that peripheral vision seems to be degraded.</P>

<P>Taste and touch do not seem to be appreciably affected, although
some users have reported that taste is enhanced and mildly
euphoria-linked. Others have reported the same effect for touch. The
sense of smell, on the other hand, is improved for some; in fact,
some find scents so overpowering that they cannot remain around
scented items.</P>

<P>Balance and body position sense can be significantly affected,
ranging from a mild disturbance (some call it "sea legs") to a near
total loss of position and balance sense (generally this only happens
on upper plateaus). The changes seem to relate to an anesthesia of
the body senses in particular. The effect (like the other sensory DXM
effects) can be euphoric; some users like to roll around, do
cartwheels, dance, march, whatever. People who are very susceptible
to motion sickness seem to report nausea, but most do not. Overall
some have described these effects as like free-fall.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.5.3.2"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>5.3.2 &nbsp; Cognitive/Emotional Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Even though DXM has a slight "stoning" or intoxicating effect on the
first plateau, there are surprisingly few deficits of cognitive
function. Language is the most strongly affected, although these
effects are usually limited to occasional word and syllable
repetition (especially in already-repeated syllables, e.g., "banana"
to "banananana"), spoonerism (e.g., "share boulders" instead of "bare
shoulders"), and difficulty coming up with specific words (the "Tip
of the Tongue" phenomenon).</P>

<P>Some users report that they feel more creative and capable of
non-linear thought on DXM, and this seems to be maximized on the
first and second plateaus. Whether this is, in fact, true, or just
seems true because of the drug, I have no idea; to my knowledge there
are no studies on this. Another cognitive characteristic that
occasionally occurs at the first plateau (but more commonly at the
second) is that things can seem much more interesting, or at least
much less dull and boring, than they usually are. There may be an
overall increase in approach-related behavior.</P>

<P>Many DXM users report a moderate to strong stimulant effect at the
first plateau, which disappears at higher dosages. This seems to be
enhanced by caffeine. One user reported being able to stay up for 48
hours by maintaining a first plateau level. (Note that I don't
recommend this).</P>

<P>Another characteristic of first (and second) plateau trips is a
lowering of inhibitions related to conversation (and to a lesser
degree to behaviour). Many people find they can discuss painful or
embarrassing topics without difficulty. This is usually described as
a very positive effect, and those who have experienced it often state
that they feel more comfortable with themselves after the trip. Some
have reported a strengthening of friendships due to this effect. It's
interesting that as the third plateau is approached, recall and
discussion of such topics seems to become more and more
"mandatory".</P>

<P>A few people seem to have problems identifying abnormal behaviour,
and some have gotten themselves into awkward social situations by
saying (or, rarely, doing) exactly what they mean. Dissociatives do
seem to inhibit the ability to unconsciously recognize and act based
upon social constructs. My personal feeling based on some observation
is that if you are consciously aware of your behaviour you are not
likely to have problems; it is those who act primarily out of
instinctual adherence to social rules that tend to behave somewhat
bizarrely.</P>

<P>Mood enhancement is the most regular emotional effect of the first
plateau; many people find themselves fairly bouncy and happy,
occasionally euphoric. Unlike many drugs, there is not usually much
"let-down" when the trip ends. Fear is rare at the first plateau.
There may be a sense of energy or drive.</P>

<P>The effects upon libido evidently tend to vary from person to
person. Some people report an increase in sex drive; others find that
playing, physical contact, music, etc., seem much more interesting
and enjoyable than sex. The effects on sexual performance itself are
not very strong at the first plateau, though males may have some
difficulty in achieving orgasm. When orgasm does occur, it is often
accompanied by extreme muscle tension and profuse sweating. <B>Note
that there may be problems with hypertension from sex on DXM</B>.</P>

<H3><CENTER>5.3.3 &nbsp; Motor Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Another identifying characteristic of a first plateau DXM trip is its
effect upon motion and motor skills. Users tend to walk and move in
specific ways (varying somewhat from person to person) characterized
by large, fluid movements. In fact, it may be difficult to perform
small or abrupt motion. Motor tasks initiated may continue beyond
their targets (this can range from fun to distracting). To an outside
observer, this can seem quite strange, especially the changes in
gait. It is possible, however, to move normally.</P>

<P>These changes may be related to euphoria- linking of body kinetic
sense (see Sensory Effects, above) which would make large and
sweeping motions more enjoyable. It is also possible that something
more directly involved in the planning and carrying out of complex
motor tasks may be at work, and that the euphoria is simply a general
phenomenon which is not directly connected to the alterations in
motor skills. Some have suggested that impaired processing of
vestibular signals (i.e., those from the middle ear which relay
position and motion information) may be involved. Activity of DXM in
the cerebellum may also contribute.</P>

<H3><CENTER>5.3.4 &nbsp; Memory Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The memory effects of a first plateau trip are slight but usually
noticeable. Most of the effects probably come from a general
deterioration of short-term memory. Working memory (the "train of
thought") can become stuck in repetitive thoughts; other times it can
be very easy to become distracted. Recall of events prior to the trip
does not seem to be degraded. Encoding (i.e., making new memories)
may be worsened, so that after the trip there is some difficulty in
recalling events during the trip. Also probably because of the
deterioration of short-term memory, it may be easy to lose track of
time.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.4 &nbsp; The Second Plateau</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
With the second plateau (around 2.5-7.5mg/kg, 6.4mg/kg suggested from
regular users) several new effects become evident. The most profound
is that DXM begins to take on a heavier "stoning" characteristic, and
senses and cognitive function are affected accordingly. Closed-eye
hallucinations start for some people on the second plateau. Some of
the first plateau effects, e.g., the music and motion linked
euphoria, may diminish or stop entirely.</P>

<P>Second plateau trips usually take between 30 and 60 minutes to
start (on an empty stomach), peak about 2 to 3 hours later, and last
about 6 hours. Again, gel capsules take up to 1 hour additional to
dissolve. Hangovers are not common with lower second plateau trips,
but some people experience them.</P>

<P>A general narrative of the second plateau: The trip beings
identically to the first plateau trip, although the alert and early
effects may be noticed earlier. After passing to the music and motion
euphoria stage, the first plateau sensations begin to be overshadowed
by disruptions in sensory processing, as sensory input begins to get
"choppy". Both sight and sound take on a dreamlike characteristic and
one begins to feel increasingly detatched from the outside world.
There may be bursts of sensory deprivation where the outside world
seems to go away, but overall one maintains contact (somewhat
incoherent) with the outside world. After a few hours of an overall
"stoned" feeling, the sensations begin to subside. A slight hangover
consisting of lethargy may be noted the next day.</P>

<H3><CENTER>5.4.1 &nbsp; Sensory Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The most general sensory effect of the second plateau is "flanging".
Flanging, also called phlanging, phasing, stop-action, framing,
strobing, etc., is the sensation that continuous sensory input has
been chopped up into frames (as if you were watching a badly animated
cartoon), often with some echo effect of each frame. There does not
seem to be any loss of sensory content; instead, it is as if the
ability to keep sensory input time-continuous were disturbed. The
best analogy from other drugs may be the effects of nitrous oxide
upon sound. The best analogy from non-drug experiences is listening
to a voice through an echo/delay effects box (which is where the term
"flanging" comes from).</P>

<P>An interesting and probably associated sensory phenomenon is that
it seems as if one is aware of several temporal stages of sensory
processing all at once. In other words, a sentence may be heard not
sound for sound or word for word, but all at once (this is difficult
to describe). Similarly, visual images may be jumbled together with
previous images. This may be due to an excessive persistence of
sensory buffering.</P>

<P>Vision in particular is changed on this plateau. Depth perception
is often lost, and the ability to keep both eyes focused on the same
thing is diminished (leading to slight double vision). This is most
noticeable in people without a dominant eye.</P>

<P>Sound, as already mentioned, tends to be flanged. With the sense
of touch, there is not necessarily flanging so much as a noticeable
delay between the stimulus and recognition of it. Pain especially
tends to be somewhat dissociated. Taste is usually simply dulled.
Many people report a vastly improved sense of smell though some
report that it is dulled as well.</P>

<P>The sense of balance is severely disrupted, as is body position
and kinetic sense. Keep in mind that dissociation of pain and the
disruption of body sense together make physical exertion somewhat
risky, as it is possible to over-exert and not notice.</P>

<P>Closed-eye hallucinations tend to begin at the second plateau (and
in fact are the reason I distinguish this from the first plateau).
Usually these are not "true" hallucinations, but instead are
considerable enhancement of imagination, up to fully eidetic imagery
(i.e., you experience lucidly what you imagine). This is especially
powerful with memories; some users are able to re-experience past
events, or "simulate" future events, as if actually there,
interacting with the environment (I call this the "Holodeck Effect").
Many users report this to be quite useful for introspection.</P>

<P>Actual hallucinations, if they do exist, tend to be abstract and
cartoon-like. There seems to be an emphasis on linear structures -
long, thin lines, or long queues of simple objects. There may also be
Lilliputian hallucinations (everything seems either way too big or
way too small, or both). Some people find considerable similarity
with fever hallucinations; this can be unpleasant.</P>

<P>Your experiences throughout the day will influence the
hallucinations you see and the imagery you can create. For example,
if you have spent the day playing
DOOM<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, your hallucinations are
likely to involve scenes and elements from the game. Eidetic imagery
works a little different - you can conjure up images, but they are
likely to have a "DOOM<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>-esque"
feel to them (bitmapped textures, ugly walls, etc.). This is an
interesting effect, and my hunch is that DXM hallucinations and
imagery may be very dependent upon what's already stored in
intermediate term memory. So it might be worth planning the events of
the day with your trip objectives in mind. This may also be possible
to some extent during the trip itself; e.g., if you want to imagine
yourself in space, go to a planetarium.</P>

<H3><CENTER>5.4.2 &nbsp; Cognitive/Emotional Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Higher reasoning is still not appreciably affected at the second
plateau; in fact one of the more interesting aspects of DXM at the
first and second plateau may be its ability to disturb one function
of the mind while leaving another almost untouched. On the other hand
the content of one's thoughts may become increasingly abstract as the
outside world is ignored.</P>

<P>An interesting cognitive effect that is pronounced at the upper
second through the third plateau is a change in self-referential
thinking. Self-referential thoughts or ideas (e.g., "this statement
is false") may seem both more understandable and more profound, both
in the abstract and on a "gut level". Thoughts can, in fact, get
quite abstract, sometimes to the point of seeming meaningless to
other observers. Quite a few people have reported some sort of
self-referential or abstracting aspect to thoughts, such as a
"self-creating and self-invoking meme" that consists of the concept
of itself. Another example is abstracting the concept of abstraction
(and abstracting that, and so on and so on). There may be an overall
blurring together of cause and effect, and causality may become an
alien concept (I've spoken to more than one quantum physics student
who enjoyed DXM).</P>

<P>Language becomes difficult, partly due to cognitive changes (as in
the first plateau), and partly due to difficulty in coordinating the
mouth and tongue motions. There may also be a direct effect on the
language-producing centers of the brain. Interpreting spoken language
is difficult due to sensory flanging. However, thinking in language
is still fairly easy.</P>

<P>The curious detachment from painful or embarrassing topics of
conversation that occurs at the first plateau continues and is much
stronger at this plateau. Again, this is generally viewed as a
positive event, although if you're not prepared to encounter and
possibly discuss your deepest, darkest secrets, you might want to
avoid higher doses until you're comfortable with DXM.</P>

<P>Another major defining characteristic of the second plateau (as
well as closed-eye hallucinations and flanging) may be the
motivational aspect. Repetitive, mundane, boring tasks suddenly
become doable, and (if one can avoid distraction) may be easily
accomplished, even if they take hours. There may be a considerable
behavioural stimulant effect remaining at the second plateau without
other feelings characteristic of stimulants. The euphoria from the
first plateau continues but diminishes as dosage across the second
plateau increases.</P>

<H3><CENTER>5.4.3 &nbsp; Motor Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The first-plateau effects on motor skills continue to exist, and may
be considerably stronger. Some users find themselves contorting their
limbs into rigid positions (and in some cases with general muscle
rigidity), others may extend and stretch themselves. These effects
are not always immediately apparent; when they are, the user usually
reports that it just "feels right" to be in that position. It is
still possible to override this.</P>

<P>Another accentuation of first-plateau motion effects that
sometimes occurs is that the large, sweeping motions, once initiated,
may continue for considerable time (looking somewhat like a cross
between modern dance and Huntington's disease). Again, it just "feels
right" to do.</P>

<P><BR>
Intermediate-term memory and working memory may be severely
disturbed, although experience with DXM seems to help people
compensate. Possibly because of the changes in memory, it may be very
difficult to get bored, even with repetitive tasks. At this plateau,
a lot of time may get lost, and the more mundane aspects of the trip
are easily forgotten after it is over.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.5 &nbsp; The Transitional Phase</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Between the second and third plateaus lies a transitional phase. Not
everyone experiences it; it seems that about 70% of DXM users have
reported at least one aspect of it. In some senses it seems to be
"programmed", in that the content of the experience, although varying
from individual to individual, does not change much from one trip to
another.</P>

<P>Overall these experiences are probably the crossing of a threshold
in dissociation. The hypothesis is this (although it is by no means
proven). Generally speaking, sensory input competes with "feedback"
input from the brain (you've probably noticed this from being deep in
thought and not noticing what is going on around you). As sensory
input becomes sufficiently inhibited, networks where sensory and
feedback information are combined and reconciled begin to gain a
larger and larger proportion of their input from internal feedback
sources. Eventually, there is enough attenuation of sensory input
(and probably intermediate-term memory as well) that the feedback
loop becomes "free-running", leading to internal states (or models,
if you prefer) that are increasingly detatched from the outside
world.</P>

<P>During this time, people generally report that they can experience
the process or they can discuss, relate, write about it; it does not
seem possible to experience it while attempting to maintain contact
with the body in any way. Unfortunately, memory of the experience is
often impaired, so one gets the feeling of having taken an incredible
ride without remembering it. Fortunately, the threshold experience
may repeat itself throughout upper plateau trips (see <A HREF="dxm_paranormal.html#toc.8.2.1">Section
8.2.1</A>).</P>

<P>If you want a very rough model for the threshold experience, get a
video camera and a television, and feed the output of the camera into
the TV. Point the video camera at the TV, turn on the date display on
the camera (to provide some sort of "sensory input"), and turn the
brightness down on the TV. Adjust the zoom on the camera to roughly
include the entire TV screen. You will notice one or two copies of
the date/time digits appearing, but overall the picture still looks
like a video of a TV screen inside a screen (or two).</P>

<P>As you increase the brightness on the TV, however, something
interesting begins to happen. Eventually, the feedback becomes
self-sustaining, and you can get extremely complex, self-reinforcing
patterns which take hold and maintain themselves. The entire picture
begins to turn into abstract blobs and colors. As you adjust the
zoom, you will find a stable point where you can wave your hand in
front of the screen and the effects of this "sensory input" will
ripple through the system, mutating constantly but never really
leaving. This also makes a fascinating trip toy, by the way.</P>

<P>Overall there are some common features to most people's threshold
experiences. The first is a sensation that has been described as the
opening of nasal passages, being full of helium, losing one's body,
or having one's heart stop beating. The actual effect is most likely
a sudden cutoff of sensory input from within the body - everything
from all the little aches and pains to the awareness of one's own
heartbeat go away. This can be very disturbing if a naive user
interprets it as heart failure!</P>

<P>The second transitional effect is a temporary loss of all sensory
input (this does not always occur), as if one were in a sensory
deprivation tank. This is often accompanied by severe Lilliputian
hallucinations, probably because there is no internal size reference
(since the rest of the universe has just gone away). One person
reported feeling as if he shrunk down to the size of a proton, and
the rest of the world were light-years away.</P>

<P>This transitional phase often repeats itself between the third and
the fourth plateaus.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.6 &nbsp; The Upper Plateaus</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The upper plateaus are considerably less "recreational" than the
lower plateaus, and are more introspective, spiritual, and shamanic.
Most people who use DXM for psychonautical exploration or spiritual
work do so at the upper plateaus. The upper plateaus generally take
more out of the user, with more frequent hangovers and moments of
dysphoria.</P>

<P>Unlike the lower plateaus, most upper plateau experiences do not
lend themselves to moving around much. Most people find it better to
find someplace comfortable and stay there. Trying to move too much
can induce nausea in some people.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.7 &nbsp; The Third Plateau</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The effects at the third plateau itself tend to be very intense, and
often very different from earlier plateaus. Keep in mind that a third
plateau trip can be terrifying to people who are not psychologically
comfortable and prepared. Because the third plateau is so
individually variant, I don't feel comfortable in trying to come up
with a narrative.</P>

<H3><CENTER>5.7.1 &nbsp; Sensory Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The flanging of visual effects, coupled with the loss of stereoscopic
vision, becomes so strong that the brain seems to completely give up
trying to process vision, leading to a sort of "chaotic blindness".
Simple images (e.g., a candle flame) are still recognizable, although
given the loss of stereoscopic vision one tends to see two of
everything. More complex images, especially images that are not
sharply defined, are difficult if not impossible to recognize.
Vision, when possible, has a very dream-like quality to it.</P>

<P>Simple sounds are still understandable, and one can usually
comprehend language, although it may be necessary for the speaker to
phrase it in a complex rhythm (see <A HREF="#toc.5.7.2">Section
5.7.2</A>). Music euphoria is rare. Touch and taste are subject to
considerable anesthesia, and pain especially may be completely
dissociated (it's still there, it just doesn't seem to apply). Body
position, kinetic, and balance senses are similarly disrupted.</P>

<P>Some people continue to report an enhanced sense of smell on the
third plateau; in a few people almost all smells are overpowering,
and subtle elements of scents may be recognizable. This can affect
taste, and ordinary foods or drinks can take on peculiar tastes as
previously unknown odors are noticed. Even the type of container can
affect the smell, with faint scents from paper cups, plastic, and
even metal noticeable.</P>

<P>Hallucinations may continue, although they tend to be more
abstract and "pre-sensory" rather than being predominantly visual.
Oftentimes there is an overall sensation of being surrounded by
"grey-ness", which brightens to white light as the dosage increases.
There do seem to be more frequent moments of "virtual world"
experiences, where one can construct an imaginary sensorium with the
eyes closed.</P>

<P>At the third plateau, the flanging of sensory input occurs both on
a raw level (sounds, images) and on higher levels (words, phrases,
faces, etc.) This is, to my knowledge, unique to DXM. Flanging may
slow down and speed up, leading to periods of lucidity alternating
with periods of semi-consciousness.</P>

<H3><CENTER>5.7.2 &nbsp; Cognitive/Emotional Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Cognitive function becomes severely disrupted at the third plateau.
Complex tasks, such as arithmetic, may be very difficult (though some
report little or no difficulty with simple skills). Reaction time is
significantly delayed. Decision-making is somewhat degraded, although
conceptual thought is less affected than concrete thought. Generally
speaking, mental tasks which do not require changing context are far
less impaired than tasks which require one to change one's
decision-making approach.</P>

<P>Those who study this sort of thing will be interested to know that
I have done some preliminary tests which show impaired results on the
"Brain Warp" toy in "combo" mode (which is a basically a simplified
Wisconsin Card Sort for kids). This probably indicates impaired
prefrontal lobe function, a hypothesis supported by some research
(<A HREF="refs.html#r226">226</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r326">326</A>).</P>

<P>Language changes can be quite significant. Sentences may stretch
on and on, or alternately be very terse (I call this the "Hemingway
Effect"). Words, syllables, and phrases are commonly repeated. This
may be related to problems with working and short-term memory. Speech
may occur in a very rigid (but not necessarily simple) rhythm, and
the user may not respond to speech unless it is in a similar
rhythm.</P>

<P>The normal "chatter" that goes on inside everyone's brain tends to
slow down or stop at this plateau, leaving a feeling of mental peace
and quiet. One person reported this as "it felt like the top of my
skull was opened into a clear blue sky".</P>

<P>Mood can range from absolute mania to panic. Many people have
independently reported feeling as if they were dying, with some sense
of fear, although some people do not seem to associate fear with
this. Some people report a great increase in approach behavior, as if
every event and object were a new experience; others find irrational
fears occurring (possibly due to body load).</P>

<P>Panic attacks have occurred at the third plateau. This can be a
scary experience, especially if one finds one's heart rate
skyrocketing due to the panic attack and doesn't know why. The best
way to cope with this is to try and calm down, much the same as one
would with a bad trip on any other hallucinogen.</P>

<P>DXM on the third plateau has a very "shamanic" feel to it. Part of
this is due to the sense of rebirth, part from the recall of
suppressed and/or partially forgotten memories (some similar effects
which I formerly placed on the third plateau (e.g., feelings of
contact with other beings) I now place on the fourth plateau as they
tend to occur at substantially different dosage levels). Complete
annihilation of self can occasionally occur (rarely up to the point
of forgetting one's identity, but more commonly just psychedelic
ego-annihilation).</P>

<P>Note that, to sober observers, the effects of a third plateau trip
can seem very unusual and unpleasant (often much more than to the
person tripping).</P>

At the third plateau it may be impossible to perform coordinated
movements. The large, sweeping motions of the first and second
plateau are no longer present. Instead, many users lack both the
desire and ability to move at this plateau.</P>

<P>Well-learned motor tasks (e.g., speaking and typing) are still
possible at this plateau, provided the user doesn't attempt to think
about them. In particular, some users have reported that they were
able to express their thoughts via typing, without even thinking
about it or realizing they were doing so; however, when they looked
at the screen or keyboard, they were no longer able to type. This is
evidently a phenomenon unique to dissociative anesthetics.</P>

<H3><CENTER>5.7.4 &nbsp; Memory Effects</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Short-term memory is seriously impaired; working memory is less
impaired. Thoughts may get stuck in a loop. Memory encoding of the
more mundane experiences of the trip tends to be very bad; expect to
forget a lot of the trip itself (a few people report that they begin
to recall events from the trip a few days after it has ended; I know
of no mechanism for this). The sense of time can be quite distorted,
both in terms of chronological placement of events and in the sense
of the passage of time.</P>

<P>The day after a third plateau DXM trip, some users feel as if
there were a break in the continuity of their memory, almost like the
close of one chapter and the beginning of another. Some find this a
very positive feeling, like a rebirth or rite of passage. It can be
disconcerting if experienced without adequate foreknowledge and
preparation.</P>

<P>One of the most significant memory effects that can occur at the
third plateau is the spontaneous recall of memories, often memories
which were hidden (consciously or not). This can be a positive
experience if one is prepared to review the darkest secrets of one's
past; otherwise it range from somewhat embarrassing to very
unpleasant and disturbing. The user may also feel compelled to tell
her or his companions about these memories (not always a good
idea).</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.8 &nbsp; The Fourth Plateau</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Information pertaining to the fourth plateau (roughly, above 15mg/kg)
is limited, and what I have gathered will be presented as a general
overview. Fourth plateau doses are similar to fully dissociative (but
pre-anaesthetic) doses of ketamine.</P>

<P>Please note that dosages in these ranges are approaching the
danger zone, and <EM>under no circumstances should anyone take this
much DXM without a sober assistant who can take you to the hospital
if the need arises!</EM> Many people neglect "trip sitters" with
psychedelics. While you can probably get away with this with LSD
(provided you remain in control enough not to do something stupid),
with DXM there may be moments of such total confusion that you can
wander into trouble without knowing what's going on. Additionally,
the danger of adverse physiological effects, although not great, is
worth paying attention to. Finally, psychotic breaks are most
frequent at fourth plateau doses (and of course increase as the
dosage increases).</P>

<P>Generally, people entering the fourth plateau report that they
lose all contact with their bodies, often suddenly. This can be
somewhat frightening. In particular, the sense of breathing is one of
those missing, and people have occasionally interpreted this as
evidence that they were dead. The surrounding environment may be
evenly colored (usually grey or white), or it may appear vividly
realistic, or cartoon-like, or anywhere in between these.</P>

<P>Many users have reported experiences very similar to "out of body"
and "near death" experiences. In such cases, many report that they
have contacted other beings, whose reaction to the user is usually
somewhere between curiosity and amusement. Contact with "superior
being(s)" has also been reported, sometimes as a raw force, sometimes
personified in some way. In the reports given to me, the "superior
being" image is more often female than male.</P>

<P>Delusions can become fairly involved at this plateau; the crucial
factor seems to be whether or not the individual realizes that the
belief or thought is drug-induced. Some people, especially those more
experienced at this level, have reported that although they were
aware that their thoughts were delusional, they didn't really care at
the time. In general these delusions are fairly harmless (e.g., "I am
a flower in the middle of a field").</P>

<P>Typically an individual in this plateau won't be moving at all,
which can be frightening to observers. In many ways this state
resembles dreaming. If someone in this plateau does attempt to move,
his or her attendants should be very sure that he or she is conscious
of these actions, and not responding to a delusional environment.</P>

<P>Somewhat surprisingly, many cognitive abilities are still intact.
Basic computational skills and long-term memory recall do not seem to
be particularly affected. It is also possible for the "body"
(actually body and some parts of the mind) to undergo fairly complex
tasks while the conscious mind is dissociated.</P>

<P>One individual wrote the following of the fourth plateau trip, and
I think it is a good explanation both of the trip and of its possible
origins:<BR>
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I've come to the conclusion that DXM is almost unique in
   it's ability to create a truly "alien" experience - one in which
   major aspects of one's humanity can become entirely irrelevant.
   Most obviously, one's body can be left behind; even forgotten. The
   experience of becoming or encountering bizarre life-forms seems at
   least somewhat common, as are weird, horizonless landscapes or
   space-scapes. I think alot of this "alieness" comes from having so
   many of one's ties to the familiar severed. When your body is
   gone, your mind loses its sense of how "big" or how "small" you
   are in relation to your surroundings. Hence hallucinations of huge
   things like galaxies, or of being as large as a mountain, as small
   as an atom, etc. I think the brain also misses subtle clues like
   the sensation of breathing, blood flowing through the veins, etc.
   - things which help remind you that you're human. And at some
   point, even your memories of the familiar may be suppressed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><CENTER>5.9 &nbsp; Plateau Sigma</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
A few people have independently contacted me about an additional
plateau -- one reached not by increasing the dosage but by prolonging
the experience. I searched for some time for a name before settling
on "Plateau Sigma", both because it seems to be related to sigma
activity (see <A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10.2">Section 10.2</A>)
and because it occurs as one sums up small doses (sigma being the
mathematical symbol for summation). This summation may lead to a
strong potentiation of the psychotomimetic effects of DXM (<A HREF="refs.html#r227">227</A>).
<B>Over half the people who had a Plateau Sigma experience have said
it was extremely unpleasant and that they would never repeat
it</B>.</P>

<P>The most commonly reported dosage regimen for Plateau Sigma is
given below. However, before giving it, I warn you strongly against
making this sort of attempt. DXM at high dosages is probably hard
both on the brain and the body, and extending the experience is
likely to increase the chance for dangerous side effects.
Furthermore, one must be experienced enough with DXM, with the
psychedelic experience in general, and with one's own mind, to be
able to understand the experience. Everyone who has reported a
successful experience with this dosage regimen has been at least 23
years of age. While I do not doubt that some younger people may be
capable of having a good experience at this plateau, most seem to be
unable to understand it and unable to control it, and there may be a
real danger of psychotic breaks. Finally, the experience is in some
ways acutely uncomfortable, as one's contact with inner and outer
reality seems to break down entirely.</P>

<P>Combining suggestions from others I have come up with the
following dosage regimen. Start relatively early in the day (the
experience degrades if one is too fatigued), at about 6 to 10 hours
after awakening. It helps tremendously if one is in good physical
shape and not under emotional stress. Take a low second plateau dose.
In three hours (or about 1 hour after the peak), take a second low
plateau dose. At three more hours (or, again, 1 hour after second
peak) take a high second plateau or low third plateau dose. After
coming down from the third plateau, instead of going back to the
second plateau and down to baseline, you may be left in Plateau
Sigma. Drugs which inhibit cytochrome P450-2D6 seem to enhance the
duration and intensity of the experience. Nicotine is reported to
inhibit it, and may even prevent it entirely.</P>

<P>At Plateau Sigma interesting things happen to reality. Some have
reported vivid, entirely realistic contacts with alien entities,
spirits, gods and goddesses. Unlike the fourth plateau, these
contacts often take place with eyes open, immersed in everyday
reality. Although none of the people who reported these experiences
to me had bad trips, most related that the experiences were so real
that they felt they easily could have.</P>

<P>Vision suffers a curious change, seeming to consist of
well-processed but highly strobed images; so strong is the effect
that it seems as if one is looking at the world under a fast strobe
light. The eyes don't seem to track in synch with the inner 3D model
of the world, so that when one looks to one side or another, the
world lurches back and forth for a moment. Interestingly, it almost
seems as if one is looking at the world from an inner vision with the
eyes closed (see <A HREF="#toc.5.11">Section 5.11</A>).</P>

<P>Finally, thoughts can be totally deranged. Connections between
entirely unrelated ideas form, causality goes out to lunch, and one's
personality seems pretty much dissolved into the universe. Expect to
hear a lot of voices; some people find themselves totally obedient to
them. There seems to be a "tireless" quality to the experience, as if
one does not feel either fatigue or emotion directly, but only
receives information from the inner voices ("sit down now, you're
tired"). There are interesting comparisons both to accounts of acute
schizophrenia and to Jaynes' postulated bicameral mind (<A HREF="refs.html#r350">350</A>).</P>

<P>Again, let me warn you of the dangers here. You are probably
stepping head first into psychosis, and unless you've got a very good
trip sitter, you might end up coming back to reality in a padded
room. Or, if you're really unlucky, you might freak out, have a
hypertensive crisis, and end up in the hospital. Chronic high-dose
use of PCP has been implicated both in deterioration of some brain
areas and in cerebral hemorrhages. While PCP stands somewhat alone
among dissociatives due to its additional and peculiar pharmacology,
one should always be cautious when blazing trails in uncharted
territory.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.10 &nbsp; Is There Anything Beyond the Fourth
Plateau?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
There may be yet another plateau beyond the fourth. One individual
took 3000mg (I don't know his weight) and survived, although he
regained consciousness in a strange location and remembered nothing
of the trip. Beyond the fourth plateau probably lies full
anaesthesia, then respiratory collapse, coma, hypoxic brain damage,
and death. Given the toxicity of DXM at doses much higher than the
fourth plateau, I don't think anyone should try and go there. You
might not be able to come back.</P>

<P>More recently, one user accidentally went beyond the fourth
plateau and had a rather unpleasant (to say the least) experience:
</P>

<P><I>Now, and interesting experience to relate. several months ago,
I accidentally took 3060mg of dxm, which at my weight then of 150lbs,
translated to about a 46.6mg/Kg 9I believe) dose.</I></P>

<P><I>Now, I won't go into the details of how I managed to take this
much, but in a nutshell, I took 1100mg and three hours later felt
nothing, so I took another 900mg. Then, once it hit me, I somehow
cleaned out the rest of my stash, for what reason, I don't
know.</I></P>

<P><I>Anyway- for the first 6 hours following my first dose, I felt
normal. Then, I experienced a normal high 2nd trip until the point
when I took the remaining 1060mg. After that point, i recall the
following things:</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<OL>
   <LI><I>falling face down on the floor in my room.</I></LI>
   
   <LI><I>wondering why my rug tasted like burned nylon, when it was
   cotton.</I></LI>
   
   <LI><I>feeling myself </I><B><I>float</I></B><I> past the 3rd and
   even 4th plateaus, they were clearly defined for me, with
   differing emotions and feelings for each one. The last thing I
   remember before passing out was looking up and seeing a 5th
   plateau, which was very dark and most definitely not happy
   looking. :) Then darknss.</I></LI>
   
   <LI><I>dropping in and out of consciousness for a period of 15
   hours, while hearing the voice of what I thought to be some higher
   being telling me repeatedly "do not do this to me again"</I></LI>
</OL>

<P><I>Approximately 25 hours after the first ingestion, I woke up,
for the first time realizing where I was and what I'd done. I crawled
to the bathroom, and found I'd lost about 4lbs due to sweating, and
was severely pale and shaky. I crawled back to my room, and found the
floor absolutely soaked with sweat, which smelled like coricidin. I
then passed out again, and woke up 6 hours later completely
refreshed, but with a slight stomachache. I grabbed come chocolate
milk and that gave me some energy back. Enough to reflect, at least.
It was then that I counted the empty foil wrappers and learned what
I'd done. I laid back and thought about this, and couldn't remember
much, but did come to believe that the 'divine voice' I'd heard was
nothing more than my brain screaming at me.</I></P>

<P><I>Since then, the trip has faded from my mind, but every time I
look at coridicin, be it in a friend's hand, or in the store, I hear
that voice again, and almost always puke instantly. As such, this
dose is NOT recommended,and will probably prove fatal to someone not
as lucky as I. </I></P>

<H2><CENTER>5.11 &nbsp; What is the "DXM Third Eye
Camera"?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The "Third Eye Camera" (or "DXM Wacky-Cam" as one person called it)
is a strange sense of vision that occurs sometimes after vision
re-integrates in upper plateau trips. It is most prominent in Plateau
Sigma experiences. There is a very pronounced strobing of vision
without afterimages. As one moves one's eyes, the world seems to zoom
back and forth (it seems that the inner model of the world isn't
staying in synch with the outside; it may be that the brain has lost
track of where the eyes are pointing). Vision is heavily dream-like
and almost seems to persist with the eyes closed.</P>

<P>Somewhat more specific is one person's explanation that the
"strobe light" seems to consist of regular pulses at roughly 8Hz,
with small duty cycle (i.e., the "pulse" phase of the strobe is
considerably shorter than the "non-pulse" phase). The frequency
suggests theta rhythm, and there is research to back this up and
potentially explain it (see <A HREF="physiological.html#toc.9.2.7">Section
9.2.7</A>). One person suggested that the strobe pulses seemed to be
a negative image of the world, or perhaps an alternative view of it.
It may be a strobing between an inner model of the visual space and
sensory input. It might also be a flashing between the left eye's
view and the right eye's view (another person suggested this). In any
case, it seems to persist only until one goes to sleep, regardless of
how much DXM is still hanging around in your body when you wake
up.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.12 &nbsp; Tussin Space, Tussin
Consciousness</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
One of the more interesting phenomena that occur after one has gained
experience with DXM is the development of a state-dependent memory.
As the DXM experience starts, one finds onesself in comfortable,
familiar territory, a space and consciousness unique to the DXM
experience. Memories of former DXM trips can become easier to recall
and more vivid. To many, this phenomenon is associated with a
physical construct, a "Tussin Space," as more than one person has
called it.</P>

<P>The exact nature of this space varies from person to person. Many
find it to be a vast, open space, full of exotic and alien
constructs, buildings and shapes. Some see crystalline towers and
cloud-like lifeforms; others see the Tussin Space as a forest,
desert, or other natural setting. Your Mileage May Vary. Many if not
most don't really see it as a physical space at all.</P>

<P>Along with this space comes the unique but consistent changes in
consciousness that lead to the state-dependent memory of the DXM
experience. Called Tussin Consciousness by some, it becomes more and
more familiar as one learns familiarity with DXM and becomes able to
compensate for the memory inhibition.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.13 &nbsp; What is the "Tussin Euphoria" and What Makes
it Unique?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
People do psychoactive drugs because in some sense they are
pleasurable or beneficial. In some cases, such as cocaine and
opiates, this takes the form of a "body high" or general euphoria
resulting from stimulation of the brain's reward centers (the
pathways of the ventral tegmental area, to be more specific). In
other cases, like marijauna and LSD, the benefits are more emotional
and intellectual. Many lab animals do not self-administer marijuana,
and to my knowledge none self-administer LSD or related
psychedelics.</P>

<P>DXM seems to lie somewhere in between; exactly where seems to
depend on the individual. There is a definite DXM euphoria (called
the "Tussin Euphoria" by the same people who refer to Tussin Space
and Tussin Consciousness), but not everyone experiences it. Some in
fact find DXM so profoundly disturbing that they never repeat the
experience. A very few seem to find such incredible meaning and
profundity to the DXM experience that it becomes psychologically
addictive.</P>

<P>The Tussin Euphoria is totally unlike the euphoria from "body
drugs" such as cocaine or heroin, and equally unlike the euphoria
from MDMA (ecstasy). Instead, it is a sensation of being totally at
peace with onesself, the universe, and other people. Ordinary cares
and concerns seem to vanish as one enters a world where anything is
possible, and the body becomes increasingly irrelevant. "Meat
pleasures" such as food and sex are no longer relevant.</P>

<P>For those susceptible to it, the lure of the Tussin Euphoria can
be significant. One person compared it to "The Nexus" from <I>Star
Trek: Generations</I>; when in the Tussin Space, time has no meaning,
and anything is possible. Basically it comes down to whether or not
you enjoy being a discarnate entity, roaming around in a
mental/spiritual world without physical interaction. Conversations
are, of course, still a part of one's interactions, and many find
great comfort and pleasure in group tripping. However, don't expect
physical contact to be particularly profound; DXM is not a substitute
for MDMA.</P>

<P>If you find yourself particularly susceptible to Tussin Euphoria,
keep in mind that with frequent use of DXM it goes away and leaves
one only with a sense of discomfort and dysphoria. In a very few
individuals, this can continue into full-blown depression. Like all
other drugs, you never get something for nothing.</P>

<H2><CENTER>5.14 &nbsp; What Can Happen with Long-term or Regular
Use?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Long-term or regular use, especially in amounts above 6mg/kg daily,
tends to produce several undesirable effects, some of which may be
dangerous. Although these are discussed in detail in <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.3">Section
6.3</A>, I will go over them briefly here.</P>

<P>The most significant risk of regular use of DXM is mental
impairment (deterioration of language, motor skills, memory; loss of
emotion; antisocial behaviour; violent ideation; etc.). Obviously
there is mental impairment while intoxicated. However, some regular
users have reported a temporary but long-term impairment (up to three
months) after discontinuing regular use of DXM. The mechanism for
this is unknown, but it has been reported with other dissociatives
(<A HREF="refs.html#r355">355</A>).</P>

<P>Permanent impairment is a more significant problem. There are two
separate mechanisms for this: Olney's lesions (see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.3.1">Section
6.3.1</A>) and hypertension-induced CVAs (stroke and cerebral
hemorrhage). Olney's lesions are a particular type of
dissociative-induced brain damage that occur in experimental animals
at between 5 and 10 times anaesthetic doses, but may also occur with
long-term use (though this is unproven). Hypertensive CVAs have been
demonstrated with PCP (<A HREF="refs.html#r355">355</A>) but not with
DXM.</P>

<P>At least one study has shown permanent cognitive impairment from
DXM (<A HREF="refs.html#r136">136</A>), and I have received three
additional reports of it (out of about 500). Generally speaking it
doesn't seem to occur except with regular use of high dosages, and
there may be underlying disorders (temporal lobe epilepsy,
susceptibility to CVAs, etc) involved.</P>

<P>To make matters even worse, long-term sigma activity may cause
permanent changes in neurons (<A HREF="refs.html#r101">101</A>),
although evidently this is predominantly a problem with other sigma
ligands like haloperidol (it took 3 days for DXM to produce the
changes haloperidol produced in a few hours).</P>

<P>A second risk concerns addiction (see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.6">Section
6.6</A>). There doesn't seem to be much risk of physical addiction;
while some have suggested that NMDA receptors upregulate with
blockade (<A HREF="refs.html#r114">114</A>), other studies dispute
this. On the other hand, psychological addiction from dissociatives
is well documented (<A HREF="refs.html#r194">194</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r202">202</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r203">203</A>).
Not everyone seems to be susceptible to this; genetic factors may be
involved. For further information see <A HREF="#toc.5.13">Section
5.13</A> and <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.3.11">Section
6.3.11</A>).</P>

<P>One person related a story of DXM addiction which may give some
perspective on the problem. The individual was roughly 60kg, and took
a dose of 480mg, three or four times a day. The total dosage was thus
1440mg to 1920mg, i.e., 24 to 32mg/kg. This individual took the
dosage regularly to maintain a constant state of profound
intoxication with a great deal of opiate-like effects; neglecting the
dose led to withdrawal symptoms consistent with opiate withdrawal,
and possibly also withdrawal from a depressant. The individual had no
history of psychological problems. The individual developed severe
depression, leading to a suicide attempt and several months in drug
rehabilitation.</P>

<P>Exactly why some individuals seem to have drug dependence problems
with DXM is unknown; it may be a function of chronic high-level use,
or it may be a function of individual physiology. PLEASE NOTE that
this user built up to this dose over a considerable time; a similar
dose in a drug-naive individual could well be fatal.</P>

<P>Dissociative-induced depression is another concern with DXM, and
has been documented (<A HREF="refs.html#r4">4</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r6">6</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r139">139-141</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r355">355</A>).
There may be biological factors involved. According to the data I
have gathered, the incidence rate may be as low as 5% or as high as
40%, depending on how you look at things (I haven't done any formal
studies yet, and in particular I have not used any established
depression inventories, so my guesstimates must be taken with due
skepticism). Paradoxically, some researchers suggest that
dissociatives are actually antidepressants, but that, unlike those
used in clinical practice, tolerance can build rapidly, leaving one
with a rebound effect.</P>

<P>Other things to worry about are hypertensive crises, serotonin
syndrome, damage to the kidneys, liver, and pancreas, heart
arrhythmias, antisocial behaviour, psychotic breaks, muscle
degeneration, etc. For the full story, see <A HREF="side_effects.html#toc.6.3">Section
6.3</A>).</P>

<P>For better or for worse, most of the pleasurable effects of DXM
tend to go away with regular use. Tolerance can build rapidly,
leaving one only with a general sensation of being high and
stupid.</P>

<P>A very few users report beneficial effects of chronic high-level
use. The effects usually include some antidepressant activity
(entirely reasonable given the possible significance of
PCP<SUB>2</SUB> receptors), stimulant activity, long-term
motivational effect, and cognitive and creative enhancement (this has
not been quantified and may be entirely subjective). It is arguable
that chronic DXM use may actually be self-medication for depression
in some people.</P>

<P>Overall, however, most people report that DXM loses its
interesting characteristics when used regularly, leaving the more
mundane and unpleasant aspects. One former user summed it up well by
stating that "being addicted to DXM was like being addicted to
heroin. Except not as fun." So <B>please</B> be careful and avoid
regular use.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.5.15"></A></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>5.15 &nbsp; Why does DXM Affect Different People So
Differently?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Several reasons. First off, there is a liver enzyme known as
cytochrome P450-2D6 (also CYP2D6, or debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase),
which metabolizes DXM. Some people lack this enzyme, and of those who
have it, subtle genetic variations can result in different activity
(<A HREF="refs.html#r10">10-18</A>). Thus, while one person may
metabolize DXM quickly, another may not (there are other pathways
which are much slower). Certain drugs - such as fluoxetine
(Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) can inhibit this enzyme
(<A HREF="refs.html#r39">39</A>). A partial list of P450-2D6
inhibiting drugs is given in <A HREF="appendices.html#toc.15.1">Section
15.1</A>.</P>

<P>Second, some of the effects of DXM are due to the DXM itself, and
some are due to its metabolite dextrorphan (DXO), which is more
similar to PCP and ketamine in its neuroreceptor activity (<A HREF="refs.html#r43">43</A>).
Some individuals may metabolize high doses of dextromethorphan to
dextrorphan more quickly than others. Incidentally, my opinion -
based on anecdotal evidence of recreational DXM use while on
fluoxetine - is that <B>both </B>DXM and dextorphan are responsible
for the psychoactive effects (yes, I changed my mind). There is
evidence to show that DXM is definitely involved, and may be
responsible for most of the lower plateau effects (<A HREF="refs.html#r32">32</A>).</P>

<P>Third, NMDA receptors are intimately involved in many areas of the
brain where a great deal of processing takes place, such as the
hippocampus and the cerebellum. In contrast to the biogenic amine
neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, and
acetylcholine) which seem to play a modulatory role, excitatory amino
acids and NMDA receptors are involved in the "nitty gritty" of brain
processes. It is possible that, due to this extensive involvement,
many different cortical and limbic circuits may be affected.</P>

<P>In fact, DXM affects at least four different binding sites (see
<A HREF="physiological.html#toc.9.2">Section 9.2</A>), and each of
these is subject to subtle variance from person to person (<A HREF="refs.html#r44">44</A>).</P>

<P>A few people have suggested that temporal lobe epilepsy may
greatly change the DXM experience (pers. comm.). If nothing else, it
has been implicated in cognitive impairment from DXM use (<A HREF="refs.html#r136">136</A>).
Additionally, some of the more profound dissociative experiences (see
<A HREF="dxm_paranormal.html#toc.8.2.1">Section 8.2.1</A>) may be
altered, and possibly amplified, by having an underlying
susceptibility to seizures.</P>

<P>There are probably a gazillion other reasons why DXM has such a
wide range of effects. Subtle differences in brain chemistry, notably
in terms of sigma receptors, may also be involved. Psychological set,
as well as setting, are undoubtedly also part of the problem.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.5.16"></A></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>5.16 &nbsp; How Does DXM Compare With Other
Dissociatives?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Third and especially fourth plateau DXM experiences seem to resemble
ketamine experiences, and based on reports of people who have done
both, the similarity is considerable. This is not surprising, since
both DXM and ketamine block NMDA receptors. Since v3.0 of the FAQ I
have heard from PCP users who have tried DXM; all of them say that
the two share little in common except at very high doses of DXM, and
that even then the experiences are significantly different. PCP
stands somewhat alone among dissociatives due to its unique
neuropharmacology.</P>

<P>The lower DXM plateaus seem to show a number of differences from
other dissociatives. This is most likely due to DXM's unique potency
at the dopamine reuptake site (the PCP<SUB>2</SUB> receptor) and the
sigma receptor. DXM's ability to block dopamine reuptake is probably
the biggest factor in its popularity at lower plateaus; neither
ketamine nor PCP have substantial ability to do this.</P>

<P>When DXM is taken in divided doses, or when it is taken with an
inhibitor of the P450-2D6 enzyme (e.g., fluoxetine), its sigma
agonist activity becomes much stronger in comparison to its effect at
the NMDA receptor. As expected, DXM taken under these conditions
differs from other dissociatives, and is sometimes reported to induce
schizophrenic-like thought processes and other unpleasant
effects.</P>
