<H1><CENTER>6 &nbsp; DXM Side Effects and Other Things to
Avoid</CENTER></H1>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Like all drugs, DXM has side effects and risks. While mild in most
people, they cannot be ignored. DXM is not a "safe drug" or a
"harmless drug" (two oxymorons if there ever were). This section
details side effects that you may encounter, and is the largest
section in the FAQ (other than trip experiences).</P>

<P>I have reported every adverse effect (side effect) that has been
related to me as a part of a DXM experience, some that have never
shown up but have occurred with other dissociatives, and a few that
are just speculation. Many of these have been isolated events; some
have occurred only when DXM was combined with other drugs. Keep in
mind when reading this section that most, if not all, of these, are
infrequent side effects. If you've ever read the little information
sheet that comes with any prescription medicine, you'll know that
pretty much any drug you take has a plethora of side effects, most of
which you'll never encounter.</P>

<P>I have tried to organize the side effects roughly by the frequency
of occurrence, but I have not performed any real statistical analysis
yet, so this is very rough. Instead of trying to give percentages I
break the frequency down into the following categories, with
additional categories for risks that occur with other dissociatives
or may occur in theory:</P>

can't happen to you.</P>

<H2><CENTER>6.1 &nbsp; What are Some Minor Risks of Occasional
Use?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Although generally very safe, you should be aware of some of the
possible adverse effects that can occur with occasional use of DXM.
These are ordered <B>roughly</B> by frequency of reporting, but I
don't have any hard figures. These are all fairly minor risks or
adverse effects, and though they may contribute to a bad trip, are
probably not cause for concern. However, (and I will repeat this
often), if in doubt, <B>see a doctor!</B></P>

<H3><CENTER>6.1.1 &nbsp; Nausea and Other Gastric
Disturbances</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Frequent</B></P>

<P>Probably the most commonly reported side effect is nausea, most
likely a simple result of gagging down a bottle or two of cough syrup
or a bunch of big gelcaps. People who use the gelcap or capsule
preparations do not, in general, experience as much nausea, although
DXM itself, like peyote, can occasionally cause nausea (this is less
common than nausea from syrups). DXM free base and "Agent Lemon" (see
<A HREF="dxm_chemistry.html#toc.11">Section 11</A>) seem to cause the
least amount of nausea.</P>

<P>Many cough syrup preparations can cause considerable amounts of
bloating and gas. Expect to pass gas for the next day. Stomach cramps
and other gastric disturbances, probably from the amount of sugars
and thickeners, are also common. Preparations with guaifenesin tend
to induce vomiting at recreational DXM levels. Mixing DXM with large
amounts of alcohol can have the same effect; one poor individual who
mixed DXM with a large quantity of alcohol vomited for over two
hours.</P>

<P>Serotonin syndrome (see <A HREF="#toc.6.2.9">Section 6.2.9</A>) is
another possible cause of nausea and diarrhea, but doesn't seem to
occur except when DXM is combined with other serotonergic drugs
(mainly antidepressants).</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.1.2 &nbsp; Dizziness</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Frequent</B></P>

<P>Closely related to nausea, DXM can cause dizziness in many users.
If you get motion sickness this is probably a bad thing; otherwise,
enjoy the free-fall sensation. Dizziness is almost certainly a result
of impaired processing of vestibular sensory input (i.e., signals
from the middle ear, where position and motion are sensed).</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.1.3 &nbsp; Mild Allergic Reactions and Histamine
Release</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Frequent</B></P>

<P>Ah, the "Robo Itch". Some people get it and some don't. There's
evidence that at least some of the cases of Robo Itch are a
psychological reaction to mild anesthesia, but many are probably a
result of histamine release - not necessarily an allergic reaction
per se, but a possible consequence of DXM's pharmacology. The itching
tends to go away, and although scratching is pleasurable (and a
loofah is wonderful), take care not to overdo it.</P>

<P>Actual allergic reactions have occurred, and often these are a
result of the "inert" ingredients, usually one of the dyes (e.g.,
tartrazine). A topical antihistamine spray might be a good idea. You
should <I>always</I> keep an oral antihistamine on-hand, at least
during your first few DXM experiences (or when trying out new
preparations). <B>Just remember not to use any prescription,
non-drowsy antihistamine with DXM</B>. Diphenhydramine
(Benadryl<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) is a good OTC
antihistamine that is probably safe to combine with DXM (at least it
hasn't caused anyone problems yet).</P>

<P>People who have used Coricidin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>
tablets have reported that the Robo Itch seems to be completely
absent. Be warned, however, that one should not use DXM+antihistamine
tablets above the second plateau due to the potential for adverse
anticholinergic effects (which if nothing else tend to cause bad
trips).</P>

<P>Note that some people find the itching to be unpleasant enough to
keep them from trying DXM again, and a few people have scratched
themselves raw. Do take care.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.1.4 &nbsp; Sexual Dysfunction</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Frequent</B></P>

<P>DXM commonly inhibits orgasm in males and occasionally in females.
When orgasm does occur it is often accompanied by profuse sweating
and muscle rigidity. Sex probably isn't a good idea due to the
potential for aggravating hypertension (see <A HREF="#toc.6.1.12">Section
6.1.12</A>). Besides, the inhibiton of tactile sense tends to make
sex a less than thrilling experience.</P>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Frequent</B></P>

<P>Many DXM users note sweating both while on DXM and for several
hours after coming down. Some have noted a peculiar odor to the
sweat, which may be metabolites of DXM or may simply be a consequence
of enhanced sense of smell. In any case, just drink lots of water and
you should be fine.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.1.6 &nbsp; Impaired Judgement and Mental
Performance</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Frequent (especially upper plateaus)</B></P>

<P>This one's a no-brainer. DXM inhibits normal mental functioning.
That's why people take it. Whether this is fun to you is, of course,
entirely up to you. Some people simply find DXM makes them feel too
stupid. There is also some evidence for impairment of judgement, so a
trip sitter is a good idea. Oh, and don't think for a moment that you
can drive on DXM; even if you can't tell, it greatly reduces reaction
time.</P>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Occasional</B></P>

<P>This seems to be fairly common but not particularly serious;
generally, a heart rate in the range of 90 to 120 can occur. This is
probably a side effect of the stimulant qualities of DXM.
Substantially higher heart rate may indicate a panic attack (see
<A HREF="#toc.6.2.1">Section 6.2.1</A>).</P>

<P>Two users have reported that benzodiazepines (esp. clonazepam)
prevent this side effect.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.1.9 &nbsp; Pupil Dilation or Constriction</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Occasional</B></P>

<P>Although it doesn't happen to everyone, some report substantial
pupil dilation on DXM, similar to the pupil dilating effect of LSD.
This is probably a dead giveaway that you're "on something", so you
might want to know if it happens to you before trying to get away
with being on DXM in public. And may your eyes dilate to the size of
saucers and attract cops for miles around if you ever drive on
DXM!</P>

<P>There are also a limited number of reports of pupil constriction.
These seem to occur with much less frequency. In both cases, pupils
remain normally responsive to light. Two people have reported to me
that their pupils were significantly different in size; usually this
is an indication of something Very Wrong going on in the brain
(hemorrhage, stroke, or other CVA), so if this happens to you, seek
medical assistance! It is possible that this may occur as a result of
asymmetrical effects of dissociatives on the cerebral cortex, and
isn't indicative of any damage at all.</P>

<B>Category: Occasional</B></P>

<P>Hot and cold flashes during the trip occasionally occur, and are
not generally serious. One user reported frequent extreme hot
flashes, which eventually got bad enough that he sought medical
assistance. A few people have reported hot flashes several days after
the DXM trip is over. This may simply be a phenomenon of sensory
dissociation, or it may be indicative of an actual fluctuation in
core temperature (see <A HREF="#toc.6.1.13">Section 6.1.13</A>).</P>

<P>A few have reported that eating a small amount of food from time
to time can prevent hot and cold flashes, so they may be related to
rise and fall in blood glucose levels.</P>

<P>Two users have reported that benzodiazepines (esp. clonazepam)
prevent this side effect.</P>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Occasional</B></P>

<P>DXM, like other dissociatives, can cause mild hypertension (high
blood pressure). This is not generally considered serious, as the
elevated blood pressure is still within the normal range. If you have
high blood pressure to begin with, stay away from DXM (or stimulants
for that matter). There are cases of serious hypertension from
dissociatives; see <A HREF="#toc.6.2.6">Section 6.2.6</A>.</P>

<P>A rise in body temperature of about 1 degree Farenheit (0.5 C) has
been noted by many users of DXM, and low-grade fever is one of the
hallmarks of dissociative intoxication. It doesn't seem to be a
serious condition. Serious rises in body temperature have been noted
with dissociatives, however; see <A HREF="#toc.6.2.5">Section

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Rare (more common with other dissociatives)</B></P>

<P>As DXM is a dissociative anesthetic, it will make you less aware
of the normal body senses, including muscle fatigue and pain. As a
result you can easily over-exert or over-stretch yourself, especially
if you are out dancing or engaging in other physical activity. Pay
close attention to your body if you plan on moving a lot.</P>

<P>On a somewhat related note, many people report that heavy exercise
under the influence of DXM can cause nausea. This seems to occur
mainly at the second plateau and above; in contrast, one user
reported swimming on a first plateau dose to be a very pleasant
experience.</P>

<P>Urticaria, a skin rash or wheal typically consisting of white or
red bumps, is rarely reported from DXM, and typically appears on the
arms or less commonly the chest or face. It is probably related to
histamine release. It goes away soon after the trip is over.</P>

<P>Two people have reported greatly increased bile secretion from
DXM. It's possible that DXM may be released into the bile and may be

<P>Some people have reported slightly to moderately inappropriate
behaviour while on DXM. The most common example of this is blurting
out whatever comes to mind, i.e., avoiding those little white lies we
normally hold on to for the sake of politeness. Other cases included
public nudity, impaired grooming, and abnormal gestures.</P>

<P>There are numerous examples in the literature of inappropriate

nobody has yet done anything terribly outrageous or dangerous while
on DXM.</P>

There are also more serious adverse effects that can occur from DXM
use. All of these should be taken seriously, and if at all in doubt
about your health, see a physician immediately. As far as I know
nobody has ever died or suffered serious injury from any of these
adverse effects, but they generally aren't pleasant either.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.2.1 &nbsp; Panic Attacks</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Occasional</B></P>

<P>Several users have reported panic attacks, and I am beginning to
think some people may be susceptible to this from DXM. This seems to
be worse when DXM is combined with other drugs, including marijuana
(cannabis). The trouble with a panic attack is, once you realize
you're having one, it can make you feel out of control of the drug
experience, which makes the panic attack even worse. This is a
difficult vicious circle for some people to break. Fortunately this
mostly seems to happen with high doses (around 10mg/kg and up).</P>

<P>If you find yourself having a panic attack, there isn't really
much that you can do for yourself except relax, take deep and even
breaths, and try to calm down. If you find yourself hyperventilating,
breathe into a paper bag (which really does work, by raising blood
CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels).</P>

<P>Benzodiazepines (Valium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> and
related drugs) are an effective treatment for panic attacks. However,
they have several drawbacks. They must be prescribed by a physician
(at least in the US), and they will usually stop the DXM experience
very suddenly. They are both psychologically and physically
addictive, and withdrawal from regular use can cause brain
damage.</P>

<P>Benzodiazepines, esp. clonazepam, may prevent panic attacks from
DXM, but must be used with care and under the guidance of a
physician.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.2.2 &nbsp; Psychotic Breaks</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Rare</B></P>

<P>Psychological side effects to psychedelics can be quite varied.
Bad trips are certainly possible, as with any drug. As with other
psychoactive drugs, especially hallucinogens, there is always the
chance that a mental illness may be triggered by the experience. Keep
in mind that DXM is related to PCP, and some people really don't get
along well with dissociative anesthetics. The chance of experiencing
a psychotic episode probably increases with dosage.</P>

<P>Many of the cases of DXM "abuse" in literature have concerned
psychotic episodes (the same is true for LSD). This probably skews
the perception of how frequent these events are, since most of the
published accounts come from hospital visits. The vast majority of
DXM users do not experience psychotic breaks. From personal
communications I have noted nine cases of DXM-induced psychotic
breaks that required hospitalization; of these, six involved regular
users.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.2.3 &nbsp; Impaired Judgement in Critical
Situations</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Rare to Very Rare</B></P>

<P>I've already mentioned how DXM impairs driving ability. It also
seems to impair judgement, both about one's abilities and one's
susceptibility to harm. This is bad news when it comes to driving and
other critical situations. So before you consider doing anything
where your life may be on the line, know good and well that DXM
<B>will</B> impair your performance.</P>

<P>Disturbingly, DXM also impairs judgement in sexual behaviour.
While it does tend to make orgasm difficult for males, it has also
been known to impair good judgement about sex. While I don't think
DXM has the same ugly potential as Rohypnol or other benzodiazepines,
it can make you stupid and fearless enough to not use protection, and
that can be a deadly mistake.</P>

<P>I have actually heard from one person about DXM being used to
lower inhibitions for the sake of getting someone's consent. This is
an entirely detestable practice, although not limited to DXM (alcohol
is used regularly for this purpose daily, but that doesn't make it
right).</P>

<P>Let me put it simply. If you and your partner want to use DXM with
the intention of having sex on it, that's your business. But if you
use DXM to lower someone's inhibitions, that's an entirely different
situation. Basically, it means you can't get laid without impairing
someone's judgement. There's a word for that: <B>loser</B>. It'll
also get you thrown in prison, where you can find out how much fun
nonconsensual sex really is.</P>

<P>Besides, it's much more fun where the other person has all their
mental and physical abilities.</P>

<P>In the case of serious hyperthermia there is an immediate need to
lower body temperature. Sponge baths with cool water and drinking
cold liquids are the safest way, although a few physicians have
recommended ice-water baths for severe cases. ALWAYS have someone
sober to make sure the person doesn't go into shock and drown.
Whenever body temperature nears 105 F (40 C) you should get medical
attention. Temperatures at or above 107 F (41 C) will probably cause
permanent brain damage.</P>

<P>There is a condition that occurs sometimes with volatile
anaesthetics called <I>Malignant Hyperthermia</I>, which is often
fatal and seems to involve genetic susceptibility. Malignant
Hyperthermia can raise temperature to 112 F (44 C) and is obviously a
different sort of threat than the one or two degree temperature rise
from dissociatives. I have never heard of it occurring with any
dissociative (anaesthetic use or not).</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.2.6 &nbsp; Serious Hypertension (High Blood
Pressure)</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Very Rare (DXM plus stimulants)</B></P>

<P>I have heard of only one serious case of hypertension, when DXM
was used in combination with pseudoephedrine. DXM itself typically
raises blood pressure slightly (although a few people experience a
drop in blood pressure). This is probably due to sympathetic
activation from DXM's dopamine reuptake inhibiton and from downstream
effects of NMDA blockade.</P>

<P>Take care combining DXM with stimulants or physical exertion.
There is always a chance of hypertensive crisis and hemorrhage, and
it's not always easy to predict. If in doubt consult a physician,
since drugs which lower blood pressure aren't commonly available, and
must be used with considerable care. Avoid DXM if you have an
existing high blood pressure condition.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.2.7 &nbsp; Rhabdomyolysis</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Non-DXM</B></P>

<P>PCP use has been cited as a cause of rhabdomyolysis, a condition
where muscle cells break down, and myoglobin and other bits and
pieces of muscle cells leak out into the bloodstream. To put it
simply, they don't belong there, and the body doesn't know what do
with them. They end up essentially clogging the kidneys, which shut
down. This can also occur with a variety of stimulant drugs,
including amphetamine and MDMA (ecstasy). Nobody's really quite sure
why this happens, although some believe it to be a combination of
repeated or excessive muscle cell activation, dehydration, and high
body temperature (not surprisingly, most MDMA-induced rhabdomyolysis
takes place at races).</P>

<P>This is of course a serious condition, but hasn't to my knowledge
ever occurred from DXM. It's not always fatal, but if enough muscle
tissue is destroyed, it can be. Needless to say, medical intervention
is required.</P>

<P>I have received anecdotal evidence from one person who complained
of prolonged illness (3-4 days) following DXM use, during which she
did not produce urine, followed by about three hours of bloody urine.
Needless to say she didn't repeat the experience. I haven't a clue if
this could have been rhabdomyolysis (and she didn't consult a
physician at the time), but obviously something was amiss with the
kidneys. Incidentally, this occurred after years of DXM use.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.2.8 &nbsp; Respiratory Depression</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Non-DXM</B></P>

<P>One of the risks of high doses of dissociatives, and in fact the
proposed mechanism for overdose fatalities, is respiratory depression
(<A HREF="refs.html#r201">201</A>). The two medically recorded deaths
due to DXM overdose (one of which was a suicide) were attributed to
this. I have never heard of any other cases of DXM-induced
respiratory depression, although I suspect it is a serious threat at
doses above 15mg/kg.</P>

<P>The real danger of respiratory depression (other than death of
course) is hypoxia (insufficient oxygen) and subsequent brain damage.
DXM does, of course, protect the brain from hypoxic damage, so
hypoxia with DXM is probably safer than an equivalent degree of
hypoxia with opiates, but there's still no need to put your brain at
risk. In the grand scheme of things hypoxia is just one risk among
many for brain damage with regular use of high-dose DXM, but the
actual data from DXM users shows that brain damage is extremely
rare.</P>

<P>A lot of people worry about respiratory depression because of a
feeling of shortness of breath that often accompanies DXM
intoxication. This may be a consequence of the brain "taking over"
breathing from conscious control, as well as impaired perception of
the breathing process. If you're really worried, stop taking DXM. I
suppose you could rig up an oxygen mask, but if you're enough of a
hardcore psychonaut to consider that you probably don't need my
help.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.2.9 &nbsp; Serotonin Syndrome</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Theoretical (especially DXM + antidepressants)</B></P>

<P>Serotonin syndrome is a recently-identified condition that
typically occurs when combining serotonergic drugs (i.e., drugs that
stimulate, or mimic, serotonin activity in the brain). Most of these
drugs are antidepressants (MAOIs, SSRIs such as
Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> or
Zoloft<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, tricyclics, lithium, and
atypical antidepressants); others include buspirone
(BuSpar<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>), MDMA (ecstasy) and
other phenethylamines, tryptophan, harmine and harmaline (both
recreational MAOIs), and possibly serotonergic hallucinogens such as
LSD, psilocybin, and DMT. <B>Phentermine, fenfulramine, and phen-fen
can also cause serotonin syndrome when combined with DXM.</B></P>

<P>DXM induces a release of serotonin, and while it has never been
demonstrated to cause serotonin syndrome by itself, it has been shown
to do so in combination with other serotonergics (<A HREF="refs.html#r365">365</A>).
In particular, combining SSRIs and DXM may be risky; one paper found
serotonin syndrome from an SSRI combined with DXM with a concurrent
vascular disease (<A HREF="refs.html#r364">364</A>).</P>

<P>Serotonin syndrome is indicated by a combination of three sets of
symptoms: changes in mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and
neuromuscular abnormalities. Specific symptoms include:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Changes in Mental Status
   
   <UL>
      <LI>hypomania</LI>
      
      <LI>confusion</LI>
      
      <LI>agitation</LI>
   </UL>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>Autonomic Dysfunction
   
   <UL>
      <LI>diarrhea</LI>
      
      <LI>low-grade fever</LI>
      
      <LI>diaphoresis (sweating)</LI>
      
      <LI>shivering</LI>
   </UL>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>Neuromuscular Abnormalities
   
   <UL>
      <LI>myoclonus (sudden, brief muscle spasms)</LI>
      
      <LI>hyperreflexia (exagerrated reflexes)</LI>
      
      <LI>ataxia (incoordination and clumsiness)</LI>
   </UL>
   </LI>
</UL>

<P>Yes, there is some overlap (e.g., shivering can considered as an
autonomic dysfunction or a neuromuscular abnormality).</P>

<P>More serious symptoms can include rhabdomyolysis (basically, your
muscle cells break open and leak muscle-cell-parts into your
bloodstream, poisoning you), coma, and death. Serotonin syndrome
deaths are rare, however.</P>

<P>Treatment of serotonin syndrome requires medical intervention, and
consists of supporting measures to treat the symptoms, and possibly
antiserotonergic drugs. Benzodiazepines (such as
Valium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) have also been used with
considerable success (<A HREF="refs.html#r366">366</A>).</P>

<P>The astute among you will notice that many of these "symptoms" are
characteristics of DXM intoxication. In fact, many serotonergic drugs
can cause these symptoms. The question is whether or not the symptoms
become severe and numerous. At least one symptom from each of the
three categories is generally required for a diagnosis of serotonin
syndrome.</P>

<P>Once again, if in doubt, see a doctor. And avoid using DXM in
combination with any antidepressant. <B>Remember, combining DXM with
a MAOI has been repeatedly fatal!</B></P>

<P><BR>

<P>It is possible to have a major allergic reaction to DXM or to one
of the inert ingredients (typically tartrazine). An antihistamine is
the obvious solution. If you are allergic to aspirin you may be
allergic to tartrazine, and in any case it is a good idea to try DXM
at a very low dosage first to rule out allergic reactions to any of
the ingredients found in cough syrups. You should also repeat the
low-dose test every time you try a new syrup, gelcap, or other DXM
formulation.</P>

<P>I have never heard of a serious case of DXM-induced histamine
release but it is a possibility. Again, an antihistamine should help,
but if things continue to get worse, get medical help.</P>

<P>Some users who have taken very high dosages of DXM (above 15mg/kg)
in products containing guaifenesin have lost motor function to the
point of choking on their tongues (or at least feeling like it; I've
been told that this is technically impossible but I've also been told
it isn't). Obviously, nobody should be experimenting at this level
without a (sober) assistant. If this happens, seek medical
assistance. While I cannot vouch for the efficacy or safety of this
procedure, I have been told that one can maintain the airway by
grabbing the person's tongue and holding it out of his or her mouth
until motor function is regained (or the ambulance comes). Don't try
to insert anything into the person's mouth; it could slip and make

<H2><CENTER>6.3 &nbsp; What Are the Risks of Regular Use and
Binges?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Prolonged, regular use of DXM has some definite risks. Generally
speaking the most common is mania, which has been reported in people
using large amounts of DXM (especially to self-medicate depression)
(<A HREF="refs.html#r1">1-3</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r132">132</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r136">136</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r139">139-141</A>).
This is probably a combined effect of dopamine reuptake inhibiton,
downstream effects of NMDA blockade, and possibly sigma receptors
(see <A HREF="neuropharm.html#toc.10">Section 10</A>). One user who
had formerly used the antidepressant bupropion
(Wellbutrin<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) reported a similar
but somewhat stronger antidepressant effect from DXM, though with
greater adverse side effects.</P>

<P>This section may also apply in the case of drug "binges" (using
DXM continuously of more than one day). This is to my knowledge much
more common with other drugs than DXM, since it does tend to induce a
fairly significant hangover after awhile (if for no other reason than
the cough syrup is hard on your stomach).</P>

<P>The most serious adverse effects are all related to brain damage.
<B>This is a well documented risk of PCP in humans and has been shown
with all dissociatives in animal models!</B> The good news is this
doesn't happen at human recreational dosage; the bad news is the
animal models may not predict the effects of regular use at lower
dosages. The other bad news is that PCP may induce brain damage by
other mechanisms; the other good news is PCP is unlike DXM or
ketamine, and neither DXM or ketamine users have shown much
impairment.</P>

<P>This time I have tried to organize by categories representing the
degree of seriousness of the adverse effects: permanent brain damage,
physical toxicity, temporary mental impairment, psychological
disorders, and miscellaneous.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.3.1 &nbsp; NMDA Antagonist Neurotoxicity (Olney's
Lesions)</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Permanent brain damage</B></P>

<P>Onley's Lesions (named after a researcher named Olney,
appropriately enough) are a particular type of damage observed from
NMDA antagonists (dissociatives). Damage occurs primarily to the
posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex (<A HREF="refs.html#r289">289</A>),
and to a lesser extent the entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, and
olfactory regions (<A HREF="refs.html#r213">213</A>). The posterior
cingulate may be involved in evaluating one's own behaviour
(<A HREF="refs.html#r316">316</A>), verbal and auditory memory
(<A HREF="refs.html#r294">294</A>), spatial memory and cognition
(<A HREF="refs.html#r316">316</A>), and language, notably metaphor
comprehension (<A HREF="refs.html#r303">303</A>). The retrosplenial
cortex may be involved in novelty encoding (<A HREF="refs.html#r321">321</A>)
and learning, memory, and emotional behaviour (<A HREF="refs.html#r324">324</A>).
The hippocampus and adjacent areas are well known to be deeply
involved in intermediate-term memory and forming relationships
between sensory data, and damage to the hippocampal formation causes
amnesia both in humans and animals. Full detail on Olney's lesions is
given below; see <A HREF="#toc.6.5">Section 6.5</A></P>

<P>If this strikes you as areas that DXM interferes with,
congratulations, you've been paying attention. On the other hand,
these are functions that, according to all human research, recovers
after occasional use of dissociatives. There is considerable
documentation of PCP users suffering deficits in language (especially
finding words), memory, cognitive skills, and motor skills (which may
be a result of PCP's peculiar toxic effects on the cerebellum not
shared by other dissociatives). Perhaps most disturbingly, this
damage also includes the ability to form emotional ties and recognize
emotions in others, and an increase in flattened affect (outward
emotionality). PCP's reputation for creating psychopaths is probably
99% media hype, but in this case (unlike most drugs the media
demonizes) it probably has a kernel of truth.</P>

<P>PC has been well studied, and an on-line review is available
(<A HREF="refs.html#r355">355</A>). Some of the papers cited in this
source are, in my opinion, a bit dated, but it provides a good
starting point for understanding what can occur with long-term
high-dosage use of dissociatives. Some speculate the damage is caused
by hypertensive strokes or hemorrhages, although it is worth noting
that this speculation was made prior to the knowledge of Olney's
lesions.</P>

<P>Studies with PCP show that this sort of damage sometimes does
resolve (though sometimes after months or years). And users of
ketamine seem to show considerably less damage than users of
equivalent amounts of PCP (pers. comm.). Even more skepticism is
warranted since one popular method for making PCP involves a
precursor chemical which, when heated, releases cyanide gas
(<A HREF="refs.html#r196">196</A>). Samples of street-grade PCP show
that many contain a fair amount of this precursor (the sloppiness of
drug chemists is probably the biggest reason to avoid synthetic
drugs).</P>

<P>Still, I have received a few anecdotal reports of DXM-induced
degradation of mental performance that are consistent with this type
of damage. To be precise, I have received eight first-hand reports of
this over the past five years, and have read about one other. Three
of the eight seemed to show permanent damage; in the other five, it
resolved after several months and may have been due to depression.
There have been numerous second-hand stories ("I heard from this
ex-girlfriend about this guy who drank a bottle of cough syrup and
his brain melted and ran out his nose"), but I don't necessarily
consider them accurate.</P>

<P>The published account (<A HREF="refs.html#r136">136</A>) involved
a 39-year-old insurance salesman who consumed 1500mg DXM, 5000mg
guaifenesin, and 3mg alcohol, about once per week. A SPECT scan
showed widespread dysfunction of the cerebral hemispheres, and EEG
mapping showed excessive right central alpha activity. The
researchers suggested a concurrent diagnosis of temporal lobe
epilepsy on the basis of extreme religiosity andexcessive
note-writing (although I've known more than one who experienced this
from DXM). His condition continued to deteriorate after ceasing DXM
use.</P>

<P>One former user told me of his experiences following use of 720mg
DXM twice to three times a week for 3 months, and then four to five
times a week for another three months. After quitting DXM, he
experienced uncontrolled shaking of muscles and severe muscle fatigue
for three years, and permanent difficulties in forming complex
thoughts into words. He described the latter as "trying to make a
complicated sentence out of alphabet soup".</P>

<P>Of the first-hand accounts, three involved concurrent use of other
drugs, in all cases stimulants (pseudoephedrine in one, amphetamines
in the other two), and in one case (DXM and amphetamine) also PCP,
ketamine, and MDMA. Of the four cases not involving other drugs, all
four used in excess of 1000mg per week, three using over 2000mg per
week, and all four for a period of at least six months.</P>

<P>To make matters even more complicated, I've also spoken to at
least twelve other people who have used in excess of 1000mg per week
for a period of one year or more, without obvious evidence of lasting
impairment. One was formally tested and showed no significant
impairment. A few of them remarked that there was a recovery period
of several months to two years during which they felt "burned
out".</P>

<P>So how do you avoid this sort of damage? Well, the obvious way is,
don't do DXM. However, people regularly use drugs which can and often
do cause brain damage (including alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, and
depressants), so I have a sneaking suspicion not everyone is going to
drop that bottle of Tussin and walk away from the medicine
cabinet.</P>

<P>The best advice I can give you, other than Just Say No, is Just
Stay Low. Keep doses as low as necessary to meet your objectives,
using meditation, sensory deprivation, theta stimulation, etc., to
boost the effects (see <A HREF="dxm_most.html#toc.7.4">Section
7.4</A>). And since I mentioned it, don't use DXM without a set
objective and goal. It is <I>not</I> a casual psychedelic which
should be taken just to relieve boredom; that's why the Goddess gave
is marijuana and mushrooms (wait, I can't say that ... strike that.)
Okay, <I>fly to somewhere where it's legal</I> and <I>then</I> smoke
marijuana. Don't break the law. But more importantly, don't use DXM
so often that it becomes damaging. Besides, like any other
psychedelic it loses its magick when used too often.</P>

<P>If you have already spent the last five years drinking gallons of
cough syrup, maybe now is the time to stop, wait a year or so, and
then decide whether you want to continue. More practical advice for
psychonauts and the hardcore is given below, in <A HREF="#toc.6.5">Section

<H3><CENTER>6.3.2 &nbsp; Cerebral Hemorrhage and Stroke</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Permanent brain damage</B></P>

<P>PCP has been repeatedly blamed for causing cerebro-vascular
accidents (CVAs) such as hemorrhages and strokes, with numerous
papers referring to this (a good review is provided in (<A HREF="refs.html#r355">355</A>)).
In conversation (pers. comm.) and "off the record" one researcher
into dissociative neurotoxicity told me that this mechanism may be
less established than it seemed, for the following reasons:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Most of the research suggesting CVA damage from PCP came out
   during the initial PCP epidemic, when it was obvious that people
   were being hurt but there wasn't much time to figure out why, and
   the research was somewhat rushed.</LI>
   
   <LI>Nobody at the time knew any mechanism for NMDA antagonist
   neurotoxicity and it wasn't considered as a possible culprit.</LI>
   
   <LI>Many people who used PCP were polydrug abusers and mixed it
   with amphetamines, cocaine, or other stimulants, a practice which
   is much more likely to result in hypertensive CVAs</LI>
   
   <LI>Much of this research was funded during the early years of the
   War on Drugs, and other research from this time is known to be
   biased.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Still, the concensus among everyone (this researcher included) is
that PCP, especially street-grade, is bad stuff, and while one hit
isn't likely to fry your brain, continued use might. Whether this is
due to Olney's lesions or CVAs is to some degree a moot point.</P>

<P>The symptoms of a CVA can include sudden (often intense)
headaches, slurred speech, ataxia, confusion, numbness or loss of
muscle control to parts of the body, and abnormal pupil responses.
That some of these are also symptoms of DXM intoxication complicates
matters for physicians, so make sure if you do see a doctor you tell
her or him about your DXM use (and what it does).</P>

<P>There is, I think, enough data to show that PCP is possible of
inducing CVAs, at least in those with underlying hypertension and who
go on "binges". It's never been demonstrated with DXM, but there
hasn't been nearly as much use of DXM as PCP either. Perhaps with
increasing recreational use of ketamine the issue will be resolved.
If you use any drug regularly you should seriously consider donating
your body to science when you die, since it really will help us in
our understanding of the actual dangers of drugs. Not that a solid
knowledge of the dangers of alcohol and tobacco stop anyone from
using them, mind you.</P>

<P>I know of one person who developed a severe headache during an
extended DXM trip, which lasted for several days. This person
experienced no loss of mental ability, but hasn't had an MRI (a type
of brain scan) either (and isn't likely to since they don't come
cheap). So who knows, it could have happened. If it makes you any
happier, a DXM-induced CVA is probably healthier than one induced by
stimulants, since the secondary quinolinic acid induced damage (see
<A HREF="general_info.html#toc.4.15.2">Section 4.15.2</A>) is blocked
by DXM. Still, that's small comfort when you risk irreversible brain
damage.</P>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Permanent Brain Damage</B></P>

<P>Some have suggested that chronic NMDA blockade may be a mechanism
for Alzheimer's disease (<A HREF="refs.html#r100">100</A>), though
this could be due to advanced stages of Olney's lesions. There is
also a remote possibility of toxicity to 5HT (serotonin) neurons due
to induced overactivity, similar to that resulting from MDMA
(<A HREF="refs.html#r52">52</A>). This has, however, never been
observed with any dissociative.</P>

<P>Excitotoxic rebound is a process by which brain cells, accustomed
to a lower level of activity, essentially "burn themselves out" when
a depressant drug is removed. Alcohol, benzodiazepines
(tranquilizers, e.g., Valium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>),
and barbiturates (sedative-hypnotics or "downers") are well known for
causing severe excitotoxic rebound. It is possible that regular use
of DXM could lead to an upregulation (i.e., increase in number) of
NMDA receptors as the body tries to compensate for the blocking
effect of DXM. Recent research suggests that NMDA receptors do not
upregulate with blockade, so excitotoxic rebound probably isn't a
major factor to worry about.</P>

There may be biological susceptibility to it. One of the problems
with mania is that, unlike depression, manic patients are often
unaware that they are suffering from a psychological disorder. In all
recorded cases, mania went away when DXM use was discontinued.</P>

<P>In addition to mania, DXM can also induce depression, although
depression is more often associated with DXM withdrawal. In a few
cases, depression can occur even during DXM intoxication. This can
range from mild dysphoria to suicide attempts, and there have been a
few anecdotal reports (unverified, at least by me) of actual suicides
among heavy DXM users. These stories were one of the reasons that one
group of DXM users discontinued using DXM. There is also a published
case of a successful suicide attempt by DXM, although it is not known
if DXM-induced depression had anything to do with it.</P>

<P>There is some research right now indicating that dissociatives may
actually have antidepressant effects (<A HREF="refs.html#r208">208</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r212">212</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r223">223</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r245">245</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r250">250</A>),
but other research casts doubt on this (<A HREF="refs.html#r225">225</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r229">229</A>).
It seems that in animal models, dissociatives can act like
antidepressants on some tests, but not necessarily others. What may
be happening is that, by inhibiting memory and overall cognitive
function, the dissociative is producing identical results in the test
models but for a completely different reason. Others suggest that
dissociative depression occurs primarily when tolerance is reached
and as a result of withdrawal, or because of a perception of
significant mental impairment and the fear that it might be
permanent. Withdrawal does improve cognitive abilities (<A HREF="refs.html#r355">355</A>).</P>

<P>Whatever the reason, it does seem to be a real risk of long-term
use. If you start finding yourself hostile or depressed, or your
friends start mentioning it, lay off the DXM for a few months and see
a mental health professional.</P>

Paranoia</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Psychological disorder</B></P>

<P>A few regular users of DXM have reported to me that, after a year
or so of constant use, they developed regular, violent ideations, and
would tend to respond in anger to any perceived threat. A few others
have noticed a paranoia while using DXM regularly. Two may have
exhibited antisocial behaviour but to my knowledge no formal tests
have been done (and in one of these cases I suspect the individual
wasn't terribly social to begin with).</P>

<P>My hunch is DXM may actually be more pleasant to antisocial
personalities because it seems to impair perception of social cues,
reduce stress related to social situations, and generally reduce
inhibitions. It may be that antisocial personalities just happen to
like DXM more than others, who don't enjoy being cut off from
interpersonal interactions and social behaviour (or who find such
interaction to be more unpleasant than most).</P>

<P>It is possible that violent ideations coupled with psychotic
breaks could result in violent behaviour; this is a well known side
effect of PCP, and can have such extreme consequences as parents
trying to kill their children (<A HREF="refs.html#r199">199</A>).
However, these cases are not nearly so common as they are made out to
be (<A HREF="refs.html#r192">192</A>). Also, one paper on PCP found
that violence was correlated with personality and background, and not
everyone was susceptible (<A HREF="refs.html#r193">193</A>).</P>

<P>The only person who reported this with whom I've communicated
after he stopped using DXM told me that these symptoms went away
after about three months.</P>

<P>DXM inhibits memory. If you use it regularly, your memory will be
impaired. No big secret here; if you smoke weed all the time you
probably won't have much of an attention span either. Still, don't
forget that it can take awhile (up to a month or so) for memory to
come back to normal after discontinuing DXM. And since DXM inhibits
encoding of memories, keep in mind that you may not have coherent
memories from times when you used DXM, even for days after the
experience. This is nothing new to alcoholics, of course, but it
isn't exactly fun in either case, and years from now you may find
yourself regretting not having remembered the times when you
regularly used DXM.</P>

<B>Category: Temporary Mental Impairment</B></P>

<P>While on high doses of DXM most people remark on impaired language
skills, especially being unable to find the correct word. With
regular use of DXM, many people have noticed that their "inner
narratives" become more and more abstract and pre-linguistic, and
that they find it more and more difficult to convert concepts into
language. Some of this may be due to the fact that the mental states
induced by DXM don't really have terms, but I have little doubt that
there is some transient (and possibly permanent) inhibition of
language skills. Although in all cases I've known of (except for
those listed above under <A HREF="#toc.6.3.1">Section 6.3.1</A>) this
has been a temporary phenomenon, it's possible that language skills
have to be re-acquired after loss of brain cells. Unproven, but
possible.</P>

<P>One person remarked that it felt as if the skills had been
somewhat forgotten due to lack of use, since DXM tended to make him
think in terms of pure concepts rather than language, and that as
soon as he started using language in his inner narratives, the skills
came back. Perhaps like muscles, mental skills must be used regularly
to stay in shape.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.3.9 &nbsp; Weight Loss</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Physical Toxicity</B></P>

<P>Before you get any stupid ideas, the weight comes back after you
stop using DXM and typically you end up worse off than before
(similar to speed in this respect). I wouldn't mention it, but I've
spoken with someone who used heroin for the weight loss (somehow I
think this person's going to get the Darwin Award). Now that I've
hopefully dissuaded everyone, here's the skinny (so to speak).
Regular use of DXM can induce weight loss, typically about 10 to 20
pounds (4.5 to 9 kg), and although I don't know how much is fat and
how much muscle, I suspect it's not all fat, since one regular user
noted a significant decrease in strength.</P>

<P>Part of this weight loss is probably due to a drop in appetite,
since it inhibits appetite for food (as well as most other physical
appetites) and since one is often nauseous from drinking cough syrup.
Part of it may be due to a stimulant effect, or an increase in
metabolic rate. Regardless of the reason, it is temporary.</P>

<B>Category: Miscellaneous</B></P>

<P>At high enough doses, DXM, like any other dissociative, can cause
loss of muscle control, but that's not what I'm referring to. With
regular use of DXM, some people have noticed extreme weakness and
muscle tremor, like that found during exhaustion with weightlifting.
Exactly is going on is beyond my knowledge; it may be related to
blood glucose (everyone who mentioned this was a regular user of
cough syrup), it may be neuromuscular in nature, or it may be a
result of exhaustion from muscle rigidity.</P>

<P>It's worth noting that DXM (more so than DXO) blocks calcium
channels, and that regular use of DXM may lead to a buildup of DXM in
the bloodstream which could eventually affect calcium channels. This
is idle speculation, however. Regardless of the cause, this sort of
problem is probably your body's way of telling you to lay off the
drugs.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.3.11 &nbsp; Habituation and Psychological
Addiction</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Miscellaneous</B></P>

<P>Anything can become psychologically addictive: drugs, television,
shopping, gambling, sex, masturbation, thumb-sucking, whatever.
Generally speaking though one can distinguish a point at which one's
habits become self- destructive, and at this point it's generally
safe to say psychological addiction has occurred.</P>

<P>There is much talk when discussing any drug about the difference
between psychological and physical addictions. At the extremes, this
isn't so difficult to understand. Rats won't self-administer LSD, and
people who take LSD compulsively are psychologically addicted. People
who use alcohol regularly eventually require alcohol for their brains
to function normally, and are considered to be physically
addicted.</P>

<P>In the middle is a grey area. Is caffeine physically addictive?
With regular use, the brain does adjust to it, and there is a
well-defined set of withdrawal symptoms, but people don't generally
think of caffeine as being physically addictive. The same holds true
for nicotine, which some rate as the most addictive drug known to
man.</P>

<P>More recently, psychological addiction has come to be understood
as the desire or need to take a drug (especially when there are
serious consequences to doing so), whether out of enjoyment of the
drug (primary psychological addiction) or out of a desire to avoid
the negative effects of withdrawal (secondary psychological
addiction).</P>

<P>There are documented accounts of DXM users who continued to use
DXM in spite of adverse consequences (<A HREF="refs.html#r136">136</A>),
and I have received about two dozen reports of people whose use of
DXM caused them significant trouble. Everyone I was able to follow up
on had discontinued use, although some experienced relapses into use.
This follows the patterns of PCP users (<A HREF="refs.html#r195">195</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r202">202-203</A>).</P>

<P>Based on this I would say that DXM is habit-forming or
psychologically addictive. How much? Well, it's hard to tell; any
rating of addictiveness is definitely subject to bias. Personally,
I'd say it's more addictive than marijuana, and probably about as
addictive as (or slightly less than) alcohol, in those susceptible to
dissociative addiction. There does seem to be some sort of factor (or
factors) which are involved, since many people can use large amounts
of DXM without ever developing a habit. Whether these factors are a
part of personality or biology is beyond my knowledge.</P>

<P>Psychological addiction is not itself a threat, although there can
be economic and social consequences to it. After all, not everyone
likes being around someone who is high all the time, and it does
impair your ability to hold down a job, go to school, and interact
with your loved ones when used to excess. More importantly, however,
regular DXM use may bring about long-lasting or even permanent mental
impairment.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.3.12 &nbsp; Tolerance and Physical
Addiction</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Miscellaneous</B></P>

<P>Tolerance and physical addiction are two different things,
although some would argue that the first is a necessary condition for
the second. Tolerance occurs where increasing doses of a drug are
required to maintain a given level of a drug's effect. One can become
tolerant to many drugs, whether they affect the mind or not; some
examples are caffeine, alcohol, stimulants, depressants, opiates,
nicotine, nasal decongestant sprays, and aspirin and related
NSAIDs.</P>

<P>Physical addiction is generally viewed as a condition where the
drug is needed for normal function of the body or brain. Tolerance to
the effects of drugs can occur without physical addiction, e.g., when
tolerance occurs as the body becomes more effecient at metabolizing
the drug. However, in the case of psychoactive drugs, tolerance and
physical addiction usually go hand in hand.</P>

<P>The big exception to this is the psychedelics. Any LSD user will
tell you that tolerance to LSD builds quickly; however, there doesn't
seem to be any "LSD withdrawal" when one stops using it that requires
one to take LSD to maintain normal function. Though I had formerly
worried about rebound excitotoxicity at NMDA receptors, it seems that
NDMA receptors do not upregulate with use of DXM; it also doesn't
appear that dissociatives are physically addictive (<A HREF="refs.html#r194">194</A>).
They do induce tolerance, some would argue extremely rapid tolerance
(called tachyphylaxis), since a second dose of a dissociative a few
hours after coming down off the first doesn't seem to induce the same
level of effects. This may be related to alcohol tachyphylaxis, since
many of the behavioural effects of alcohol may be a result of (direct
or indirect) NMDA blockade.</P>

<P>To sum it up, DXM does seem to induce tolerance (and I would guess
it is cross-tolerant with PCP and ketamine, but nobody's ever tested
that), but there does not seem to be an appreciable withdrawal
symptom beyond drug craving (<A HREF="refs.html#r194">194</A>). Some
might disagree, pointing out a definite set of withdrawal symptoms
from dissociatives including restlessness, dysphoria, depression, and
flattened affect, but these may just be an effect of long-term use
itself that persists for some time after discontinuing the drug.</P>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Psychological Disorder</B></P>

<P>DXM, like other psychedelics (and for that matter any intense
experience) can induce psychotic breaks which can be long-lasting.
Personal susceptibility seems to be involved here, and some people
may have latent mental problems which are triggered by DXM. I
definitely would advise against DXM use if you have a history or
family history of mental illness, especially schizophrenia,
depressive disorders, or antisocial personality traits.</P>

<P>The threat for this sort of thing goes up as use becomes more
regular, and some have noted that DXM made them a little bit crazy
when they were using it regularly. One person with whom I spoke
didn't think this was such a bad thing, but none of the others
enjoyed it much. This isn't a particularly common problem, but
shouldn't be ignored either. You never know if you're susceptible to
a psychotic break until you have one, and coming to your senses in a
padded room probably isn't the best trip in the world. Treatment
includes antipsychotic drugs and in rare cases electroshock
(<A HREF="refs.html#r200">200</A>).</P>

<P>Some research has linked sigma receptors to schizophrenia
(<A HREF="refs.html#r46">46-49</A>), and chronic use of NMDA
antagonists has been shown to upregulate (increase the number or
activity of) dopamine receptors (<A HREF="refs.html#r50">50</A>).
This could theoretically mean that DXM could trigger schizophrenia or
mania in susceptible individuals. Some researchers have suggested
that chronic NMDA blockade and/or sigma activity may be responsible
for schizophrenia (<A HREF="refs.html#r100">100</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.3.14 &nbsp; Liver, Kidney, and Pancreas
Damage</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Category: Physical Toxicity</B></P>

<P>I have found no evidence of damage to the liver, kidney, or
pancreas from DXM in medical research, however, there are potential
mechanisms for it. DXM itself is metabolized fairly easily; it's the
inactive ingredients and some of the more unlikely side effects one
has to worry about.</P>

<P>Drinking cough syrup dumps glucose into your bloodstream, and
doing this repeatedly on an empty stomach probably puts a load on
your pancreas (and stomach, adrenal glands, and probably other parts
of your body as well). True, that's their job, but one can overwork
any organ. A few long-term users of DXM have reported that after
years of use they became intolerant to any amount of sugar on an
empty stomach.</P>

<P>There's also the possibility of damage to the liver, especially if
the enzymes inhibited by DXM (cytochromes P450-2D6, 3A4, and 3A5) are
also involved in metabolizing something else, and that something else
ends up being metabolized by another enzyme into something dangerous.
This is the sort of thing one has to worry about when inhibiting
liver enzymes, and it does occasionally cause problems; as an
example, DXM will compete for the enzyme which degrades the
prescription antihistamine terfenadine
(Seldane<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>). It may happen that the
new metabolite of something is a cell toxin and will wreck your
liver; this is a proposed mechanism for acetaminophen toxicity. If
you are worried, there are blood tests which can assess liver
function.</P>

<P>Finally, I received anecdotal evidence from one person about
potential kidney damage. This person had used DXM numerous times
without problem until once (after a year of regular use) when, while
using during a flu, experienced kidney dysfunction and bloody urine.
Years later when trying DXM again, the effect repeated itself, with
kidney pain, lack of urine production, and (a few days later when her
kidneys started to produce urine again), blood in the urine.</P>

<P>Needless to say if this happens to you, it's a good sign you
should stop.</P>

DXM may decrease immune function due to sigma activity (<A HREF="refs.html#r51">51</A>).
Chronic use of NMDA antagonists seems to modify alcohol tolerance;
this is based mostly on anecdotal evidence and theory, but it appears
to be a very real phenomenon. If true, then it is important to note
that the GABA receptor effects of alcohol may NOT be changed; in
practical terms, you might be a lot drunker than you feel, and this
could possibly lead to alcohol poisoning. Be careful, and limit
yourself to as little alcohol as possible when using DXM. A recent
paper supports the ability of DXM to affect alcohol tolerance
(<A HREF="refs.html#r53">53</A>) although this paper was concerned
with a different effect, i.e., prevention of learned tolerance by
NMDA antagonists.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.3.17 &nbsp; Summary: Regular Use
Considered</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
There are obvious societal consequences to regularly using a drug
which can significantly alter or impair function, and though I
shouldn't need to bring this up, I'd better do so anyway. One user of
DXM who sent me email reported that he had lost his job, his wife,
and his friends because his regular use of DXM made him unable to
function in society. He seemed happy, and perhaps he found his own
curious form of nirvana, but if he had been given the choice before
using DXM with foreknowledge of the consequences he might have chosen
differently.</P>

<P>I realize that most people go through irresponsible phases where
they don't really care about the consequences of their actions. Now,
I truly believe that, as long as those consequences don't involve the
<I>physical</I> harm to others, that's your business. Someone who
cares about you has every right to try to talk you out of it, but
ultimately, it's your life, and all too often people see any
behaviour they don't understand (or like) as self-destructive. I've
known racists who believed that associating with members of other
races was self-destructive, and that certainly doesn't make it
true.</P>

<P>However, before doing anything that may change your outlook on
life significantly, ask yourself if you are ready for the changes
that may occur, for the loss of those things you now consider
significant. Ideally one would consider this before making any big
decision in life, regardless of whether it is marraige, divorce,
taking a new job, becoming a Tibetan monk, joining the French Foreign
Legion, or doing too many drugs.</P>

<P>Remember though, that regular use of DXM may cause long-lasting,
even permanent changes in consciousness, mental ability, and
personality. Don't jump into the deep end without knowing how to swim
and knowing what's waiting for you down there.</P>

<H2><CENTER>6.5 &nbsp; What is NMDA Antagonist Neurotoxicity and How
do I Prevent It?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
When NMDA antagonists were first studied they seemed like a dream
come true: here were drugs which could block from part to all of the
damage from strokes, head injury, hypoxia, polio, and a variety of
other conditions. However, it seems that nature never gives something
for nothing, and here too there was another side to the coin.</P>

<P>The dream ended when Olney et al. demonstrated that animals given
huge doses of dizocilpine (MK-801), a new dissociative used in
research, showed curious vacuoles (essentially, tiny holes) in tissue
samples in the posterior cingulate cortex and retrosplenial cortex of
lab animals (<A HREF="refs.html#r174">174</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r177">177</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r180">180-182</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r217">217</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r307">307-308</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r323">323</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r329">329</A>).
Further research showed that other indicators of damage were present,
such as proliferation of microglia and induction of a protein called
HSP70 (Heat-Shock Protein 70) (<A HREF="refs.html#r173">173</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r325">325</A>).</P>

<P>Since then, Onley's lesions, also known as NMDA Antagonist
Neurotoxicity or NAN, have been discovered with ketamine (<A HREF="refs.html#r325">325</A>),
PCP (<A HREF="refs.html#r302">302</A>), and dextrorphan (<A HREF="refs.html#r177">177</A>),
all noncompetitive NMDA antagonists. Competitive NMDA antagonists
have also been shown to cause Olney's lesions (<A HREF="refs.html#r213">213</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r312">312</A>).
PCP causes additional damage to the cerebellum and other areas,
possibly due to its unique pharmacology (<A HREF="refs.html#r302">302</A>).
Drugs which bind to the polyamine site on the NMDA receptor evidently
do not cause Olney's lesions (<A HREF="refs.html#r318">318</A>),
although nobody is quite sure why. Curiously, NAN may be worse in
females than in males (<A HREF="refs.html#r290">290</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.5.1 &nbsp; Overview and Mechanism of Olney's
Lesions</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The mechanism for Olney's damage is still being sorted out, and is
somewhat perplexing, since NMDA antagonists generally protect neural
tissue from damage rather than causing it. Trying to tie everything
together is a little like trying to solve a crime with only
circumstantial evidence; there are clues, but nobody's been able to
watch the criminal in action. Here is what current research seems to
indicate, pieced together into a coherent whole. A simplified
explanation is given below.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Dissociative anaesthetics activate neurons in the posterior
   cingulate cortex (PC) and retrosplenial cortex (RC) in lab animals
   (and presumably humans) (<A HREF="refs.html#r289">289</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r310">310</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r322">322</A>).
   There is also secondary, "downstream" activation of neurons in the
   entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and olfactory
   regions (<A HREF="refs.html#r213">213</A>).<BR>
   There are two theories for why this happens; either one, both, or
   neither could be true. One theory is that NMDA receptors are found
   on inhibitory GABA interneurons, and that when these receptors are
   bocked, these interneurons secrete less GABA, and thus excitatory
   pyramidal neurons that normally receive a lot of GABA inhibition
   are overexcited.<BR>
   The other theory is that the PC and RC are less affected by NMDA
   blockade than the hippocampus (and related areas), and that these
   formations serve as feedback to the hippocampus and surrounding
   networks. As these limbic networks are inhibited, the PC and RC
   increase their output to compensate, resulting in overactivity
   (<A HREF="refs.html#r300">300</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI>The overactive cells begin to heat up, use up their energy
   supply generate toxic waste products, and/or let in too many
   calcium ions (<A HREF="refs.html#r182">182</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r217">217</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r300">300</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r308">308</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI>Regardless of the mechanism, or whether the mechanism is none
   of the above, the overactivity seems to cause intracellular
   organelles (notably mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) to
   malfunction (<A HREF="refs.html#r174">174</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r182">182</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r217">217</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI>The mitochondria probably lose their proton gradient and allow
   their innards to spill into the surrounding cell material, where
   they cause all sorts of trouble, possibly including forming free
   radicals which cause further damage to the cell. Another
   possibility is that the free radicals come first, and they cause
   damage to the mitochondria and other organelles. Mitochondrial
   damage can occur within 15 minutes of the drug dose, the
   endoplasmic reticulum is damaged 30 minutes, and in both cases
   gets worse as time progresses (<A HREF="refs.html#r308">308</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI>The cell responds to this damage with a protein called HSP70.
   This "heat shock" protein is made and activated when something
   (such as overheating, thus the name "heat shock protein" or HSP)
   is causing a cell to malfunction so badly as to be in danger of
   self-destructing, and its job is to turn the cell off until
   repairs can be made (<A HREF="refs.html#r325">325</A>). Hopefully,
   the cell will get a lot of rest (about 24 hours (<A HREF="refs.html#r322">322</A>))
   until it goes back to normal. <B>At this point the problem is
   still reversible and the brain cells have not been permanently
   damaged</B> (<A HREF="refs.html#r177">177</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI>If the cell continues to be overexcited, it eventually burns
   out completely as the increased temperature, disrupted ion
   gradient, hypoxia, calcium ions, free radicals, and/or buildup of
   waste products kill it. At this point, surrounding support cells
   called microglia are activated and come in and eat the cell
   (probably under the theory that if an infectious organism caused
   the cell death, it'd better be destroyed before the infection can
   spread) (<A HREF="refs.html#r173">173</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r325">325</A>).</LI>
   
   <LI>Then, scientists come along, freeze the brain, and slice it up
   into thin slivers. During the fixing process (<A HREF="refs.html#r307">307</A>),
   the disrupted intracellular organelles expand to form vacuoles,
   the HSP70 shows up with tests designed to look for it, and the
   dead cells and proliferating microglia show up on microscope
   slides.</LI>
   
   <LI>The scientists take pictures, publish papers, thank their
   lucky stars that they aren't the rats who just took ten times the
   human anaesthetic dose of dizocilpine, and go home and fix
   martinis, smoke cigarettes, eat fast food, and engage in other
   sanctioned risk-taking behaviour (that's a joke ... yes I know
   there's a difference between a behaviour that kills you in twenty
   years and one which causes immediate brain damage).</LI>
</OL>

<P>A layman's explanation of the above: when you take too high a dose
of dissociatives, a few parts of your brain become wildly
overexcited, the brain cells get damaged, try to shut down, and (if
damaged beyond repair) die. Support cells come in to clean up the
mess, and you're left with permanent brain damage.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.5.3 &nbsp; Balancing the Risks: Is Olney's Research
Relevant to DXM Use?</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Obviously there are still a lot of questions to be answered. The most
important for human users of dissociatives is whether this type of
damage can occur at recreational levels, and if so, what can be done
about it.</P>

<P>Let's review the evidence both for and against Olney's lesions in
human users of dissociatives. First, the evidence for. The posterior
cingulate and retrosplenial cortex (PC and RC) are involved in skills
which seem to be impaired in regular users of dissociatives. Olney's
lesions occur at doses several times the recreational dose, but
that's at one dose of the drug; repeated doses of lower amounts may
cause the same damage. Olney's lesions are also only generally
visible when large numbers of cells are destroyed, and they're
significant enough to be visible under the microscope. Finally,
conditions which increase the likelihood of Olney's lesions, such as
less than ideal blood circulation to the brain, large amounts of
glucose (<B>like that found in cough syrup</B>), concurrent use of
stimulants, physical stress, hypertension, and the like, are all
commonly found in drug users, who don't tend to be the healthiest lot
(this is a generalization, of course).</P>

<P>On the other hand, Onley's lesions have never been found at human
recreational levels, and DXM has received little attention. Ketamine
users, some of whom have used ketamine for many years, don't
typically show mental impairment. Even the few DXM users who do show
impairment typically return to normal after staying off DXM for
several months, and at least one paper suggests the mental impairment
from dissociatives may be caused by depression, not brain damage
(<A HREF="refs.html#r355">355</A>). DXM is typically found in
hydrobromide form, and bromide is a CNS depressant and may prevent
damage to the PC/RC (incidentally, that's not the reason DXM HBr is
used; DXM HBr just happens to be more water-soluble than any other
form). DXM syrups usually contain alcohol, which also depresses the
CNS. And, the lower plateaus of DXM are equivalent to doses of
ketamine and PCP lower than commonly used recreationally.</P>

<P>Weighing the two sides I personally believe that moderate use of
dissociatives is probably no harder on your brain cells than moderate
use of alcohol or amphetamines (I said <I>moderate</I> use, not some
five day fry-yer-brain speedfreak binge), and that if you use DXM
sparingly (e.g., once or twice a month at lower plateaus, maybe once
or twice a year at upper plateaus), you'll be just fine. In fact,
I've never known anyone to suffer lasting impairment even after going
through a few months of weekly DXM use at upper plateaus. But <B>I
could be wrong!</B> Mild brain damage has a nasty way of showing up
years later when you've forgotten about the stupid things you did
when you were young.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.5.4 &nbsp; A Look at the Areas Involved</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Nobody's totally sure exactly what most parts of the brain do, but
there is some evidence which may indicate possible functions for the
posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex. Although our
understanding is far from complete, and mine is considerably worse
than that, I'll try to put together the published results into a
coherent whole.</P>

<P>The posterior cingulate cortex is the posterior (rear) part of the
cingulate cortex, a section of the cerebral cortex interconnected
with the limbic areas. The front part of the cingulate cortex is
called, appropriately enough, the anterior cingulate cortex. Like
most areas of the brain, the boundaries of the cingulate cortex are
somewhat indistinct. There are differences between the posterior and
anterior cingulate cortex (beyond the obvious one of location);
notably, the anterior cingulate cortex has fewer pyramidal neurons
than the posterior cingulate, and in the anterior cingulate these
neurons have more complex connections (<A HREF="refs.html#r310">310</A>).
This entire area may relay information between the hippocampus (and
other limbic systems) and other areas of the brain (<A HREF="refs.html#r298">298</A>).</P>

<P>There is a lot of disconnected research that points towards
possible purposes for the posterior cingulate cortex. It may be one
of the components of verbal and auditory memory (<A HREF="refs.html#r294">294</A>),
multisensory perception (<A HREF="refs.html#r315">315</A>),
visuospatial cognition and/or evaluation of emotional behaviour
(<A HREF="refs.html#r316">316</A>). The right hemisphere posterior
cingulate is activated in comprehension of metaphors (<A HREF="refs.html#r303">303</A>),
and the left in associative learning (<A HREF="refs.html#r304">304</A>).
Story comprehension seems to use the posterior cingulate (<A HREF="refs.html#r292">292</A>).
In late Alzheimer's disease the posterior cingulate may be subject to
atrophy (<A HREF="refs.html#r314">314</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r317">317</A>).
It is activated during anxiety (<A HREF="refs.html#r313">313</A>) and
in OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) (<A HREF="refs.html#r305">305</A>)
but deactivated during phobic fear (<A HREF="refs.html#r299">299</A>).</P>

<P>It has been suggested that the cingulate cortex in general may be
involved in evaluating (posterior) and acting on (anterior) one's own
behaviour and spatial orientation (<A HREF="refs.html#r316">316</A>).
This is, in my opinion, the most comprehensive view of the existing
research. To put it simply, the job of the posterior cingulate cortex
might be to evaluate and consider where you are and what you're
doing. Since dissociatives tend to interfere with the ability to
evaluate one's own behaviour, it may be that the posterior cingulate
is a part of a self-evaluation system.</P>

<P>Another paper (<A HREF="refs.html#r311">311</A>) analyzed the
network properties of the posterior cingulate, and suggested that
neural output from the hippocampus that was in sync with the theta
rhythm would pass through the posterior cingulate cortex in
preference to other routes. What makes this so interesting is that
the flanging or strobing effects of DXM seem to occur at theta
rhythm, which may be a consequence of DXM's effects on the posterior
cingulate.</P>

<P>There was considerably less information published on the
retrosplenial cortex. One paper found that it was activated during
the encoding of novel situations (<A HREF="refs.html#r321">321</A>).
Another (<A HREF="refs.html#r324">324</A>) suggests that the
circuitry between the retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus is an
important path by which the hippocampus affects learning, memory, and
emotional behaviour. Numerous papers suggest it has a role in visual
processing.</P>

<P>Hopefully I'll be able to fill this area in with more information
as my knowledge of (and the amount of published information on) these
two areas of the brain increase. Until then, make what you will of
the rather sparse information I have provided.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.5.5 &nbsp; Preventing and Limiting NMDA Antagonist
Neurotoxicity</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
So what can you do about this? Well the best thing I can tell you is,
stay away from drugs that might give you brain damage, whether it's
DXM, alcohol, stimulants, benzodiazepines, PCP, or glue. If marijuana
were legal I'd say smoke as much as you want (keep in mind that the
<I>smoke</I> isn't terribly good for your lungs though), since there
have been numerous studies which have shown no neurotoxic effect from
marijuana. But since marijuana ain't legal, ... well, there's always
caffeine I guess (until that's made illegal too).</P>

<P>Realistically, I know many of you are going to keep using DXM,
especially since it obviously doesn't impair everyone who uses it
(even in large amounts). People regularly make choices to engage in
risk-taking behaviour, whether it's rock climbing, driving too fast
(or without a seat belt), eating red meat, not exercising, or taking
drugs. Ultimately that's your choice. Society has made many drugs
illegal, and many argue that if drugs were legalized that would give
them an aura of legitimacy and safety, but it's legal to sit around
and watch TV all day, eat nothing but cheeseburgers, bathe only once
a month, and hit yourself on the head with a hammer, and even as a
child I never believed that legality made any of these a good
idea.</P>

<P>So here are some practical suggestions based on research into
Olney's lesions, which may work, may do nothing at all, or may make
it worse. It's up to you to decide, but keep in mind that tomorrow it
may turn out that any one of these is helping to fry your brain.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Avoid stimulants of any kind with DXM, especially yohimbine.
   Alpha<SUB>2</SUB> agonists seem to prevent Olney's lesions
   (<A HREF="refs.html#r175">175</A>); yohimbine, an
   alpha<SUB>2</SUB> antagonist, could instead make the problem much,
   much worse.</LI>
   
   <LI>Make sure you are in good physical condition, with low blood
   pressure and low cholesterol. The ability of brain cells to
   recover from metabolic insults is vastly improved if cerebral
   blood circulation is in good shape.</LI>
   
   <LI>Consider Coenzyme Q10 supplementation. One paper suggested
   that Q10 might be useful in some types of neural lesions
   (<A HREF="refs.html#r216">216</A>). It has been suggested that, as
   a mitochondrial energy substrate, it may prevent brain cells from
   "running out of fuel".</LI>
   
   <LI>Consider a <B>very mild</B> CNS depressant, like a glass of
   wine or a beer. I wouldn't go much beyond this, since combining
   DXM with too much alcohol can lead to severe nausea. A
   benzodiazepine is probably overkill.</LI>
   
   <LI>Use gelcaps or capsules instead of syrups, which contain
   glucose; the presence of high glucose levels seems to make things
   worse.</LI>
   
   <LI>Limit use of DXM extract, which doesn't contain bromide ions,
   or use it in conjunction with a little alcohol.</LI>
   
   <LI>Limit frequency and dosage of DXM</LI>
   
   <LI>Give your brain a rest of at least 48 hours after using
   DXM</LI>
   
   <LI>Eat healthily before, during, and after DXM use</LI>
   
   <LI>Consider an alpha2 agonist (<A HREF="refs.html#r175">175</A>).
   Or maybe not; the research isn't conclusive on this yet.</LI>
   
   <LI>Regularly monitor your mental skills and have others monitor
   them as well.</LI>
   
   <LI>Make each DXM trip count so you don't feel the urge to
   reattempt an unfulfilling trip experience.</LI>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.6.6"></A></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>6.6 &nbsp; Is DXM Addictive?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
From one viewpoint, of course, anything can be addictive --
television, chocolate, masturbation, self-mutilation, etc. So in that
sense, yes, DXM can be addictive. Somewhat more relevant are the
degree to which DXM is addictive, and how such addiction manifests
itself. The quick answer is, DXM can be addictive if you use too
much, too often.</P>

<P>The traditional distinction made with respect to addiction is
between physical addiction and psychological addiction. As examples,
alcohol is physically addictive, whereas marijuana is psychologically
addictive. Unfortunately this distinction has its problems - not the
least of which is that since the brain is a physical construct, any
addiction is in some sense "physical."</P>

<P>As physical addiction is a somewhat nebulous concept at best, I
prefer to use the concrete ideas of tolerance and serious withdrawal
symptoms. Tolerance is a process by which the body and brain adjust
to a drug so that the dosage must be increased to achieve the same
effect (some drugs, such as nitrous oxide, exhibit <I>reverse
tolerance</I>, becoming more potent the more often they are used).
"Serious" withdrawal symptoms is somewhat less clear, unfortunately.
Note that it is possible to become tolerant to a drug without being
psychologically addicted; in fact, some people lose the desire to use
a drug when tolerance takes away its more interesting effects.</P>

<P>There is considerable evidence based on personal reports that
tolerance to DXM's more interesting dissociative effects builds
quickly. This is a result of upregulation or sensitization of NMDA
receptors, as well as possible changes in other receptors and systems
indirectly affected by DXM. Cross-tolerance exists between DXM, PCP
and ketamine, naturally. Some people seem to be immune to tolerance
to dissociatives including DXM (lucky them).</P>

<P>Usually it takes several doses before tolerance is noticeable,
although a few people have noted tolerance after just one dose.
Larger doses will lead to quicker tolerance. Once tolerance has
built, it takes at least three weeks before receptors will reregulate
to normal levels. To avoid this problem, it is probably best to dose
only once a week at most. Also, some people believe that receptors
which are upregulated (or downregulated) for long periods of time may
tend to stay that way. The practical upshot is you should take a
month off every now and then (a good idea with any drug,
incidentally).</P>

<P>Interestingly, the first plateau music euphoria effect also seems
to disappear with repeated use of DXM. It's also one of the last
effects to come back. This may be due to downregulation of dopamine
receptors rather than upregulation of NMDA receptors. The practical
upshot is, don't do DXM all the time. Again, some people are luckily
immune to this tolerance effect.</P>

<P>For information on withdrawal and withdrawal symptoms, refer to
the next section.</P>

<P>Psychological addiction to DXM has been noted a few times, and can
theoretically lead to physical addiction. Generally, though,
dissociatives aren't considered particularly habit-forming, since
they tend to have such "heavy" effects. Low-dose DXM might be an
exception due to its moderate to strong stimulant effect; in
practicality, it's probably too hard to consistently hit the first
plateau.</P>

<P>There are exceptions, some of them notable. One case report
(<A HREF="refs.html#r132">132</A>) involved a 23-year old male who
maintained an incredible daily dose of 30mg/kg to 40mg/kg DXM (plus a
six-pack of beer)! Needless to say, after maintaining this dose long
enough, he had become addicted, although the authors consider it a
"psychological" addiction, with withdrawal symptoms such as
dysphoria, depression, and anxiety.</P>

<P>Most people who use DXM have noticed little or no addiction, and
only mild tolerance (don't let that scare you; remember that coffee
produces both tolerance and withdrawal symptoms). A few unfortunate
people have developed problems with DXM. Prolonged, heavy use of DXM
seems to induce dysphoria, anxiety, and/or depression in some people;
as the dosage is increased, the problem gets worse. Unfortunately, at
this point, there may be withdrawal problems (see the next section).
If this happens to you, seek medical assistance.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.6.7"></A></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>6.7 &nbsp; Is DXM Withdrawal Dangerous?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Withdrawal from <I>occasional </I>DXM use is almost certainly not
dangerous, and in fact any "symptoms" felt are probably just
"jonesing" - the same sort of withdrawal "symptoms" felt with
marijuana, television, sex, etc. At this point it's a matter of
willpower more than anything else.</P>

<P>Once tolerance has built, withdrawal has the potential to cause
more serious problems. Mild tolerance to DXM is probably no more
dangerous than mild tolerance to alcohol (tolerance at the level of
"being able to hold your liquor"). Withdrawal may produce boredom and
mild anxiety, but rarely anything more troubling than that.</P>

<P>One person reported a curious withdrawal effect which has also
been noted upon cessation of SSRI antidepressant therapy. Whenever
moving his eyes, or upon any sudden change in sensory input, he
experienced a sudden, momentary dizziness and altered consciousness.
Ginko biloba, exercise, and sleep were reported to all help with
this.</P>

<P>Beyond the mild tolerance level, things could get rapidly worse.
There is evidence that significant NMDA upregulation can lead to
(<A HREF="refs.html#r100">100</A>) and many of the symptoms of opiate
withdrawal may occur via a similar mechanism (<A HREF="refs.html#r109">109</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r133">133</A>).
The good news is, studies generally haven't found any significant
evidence of brain damage from heroin withdrawal, so withdrawal from
DXM probably wouldn't be much trouble. The bad news is, heroin
withdrawal isn't particularly enjoyable.</P>

<P>Interestingly, one person who developed addiction and tolerance to
DXM also compared the withdrawal symptoms to those of heroin
(although DXM never produced any of the positive effects of opiates
in this individual). These symptoms included watery eyes, stuffy
nose, gooseflesh, muscle spasms, increased pain sensitivity, nausea,
anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, the individual eventually began
to develop some of these symptoms even while using DXM. This is
definitely something to avoid.</P>

<P>If you happen to develop a significant degree of tolerance to DXM,
it might be a good idea not to quit "cold turkey" (all at once).
Build down slowly over a few weeks, and avoid all other drugs in the
mean time. One person who had been using DXM twice daily reported no
withdrawal symptoms after decreasing the dosage 10% per day, and
stopping at 180mg. This should prevent any excitotoxic rebound.</P>

<P>On the other hand, given the research from Olney et al (see
<A HREF="#toc.6.3.1">Section 6.3.1</A>, it may be better to go ahead
and quit cold turkey after all. Some research casts doubt upon
upregulation of NMDA receptors with blockade, and if so, then there
may be no danger to quitting DXM completely without tapering down. To
be honest, there is evidence on both sides, and the best advice I can
give you is not to get into this situation in the first place. If you
do manage to develop a DXM addiction, I wish you the best of luck,
and I think your best course of action would be to see a physician.
Since most medical authorities are ignorant of DXM's psychoactive
potential, it would probably be advisable to treat it as an addiction
to any other dissociative (ketamine or PCP).</P>

<H2><CENTER>6.8 &nbsp; Kicking the DXM Habit: What to Do If You are
Addicted</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The first thing to understand about DXM addiction is that most people
who find themselves addicted use DXM on a very regular basis --
weekly, or (more frequently) daily. <B>This is very dangerous!</B>.
It is vital that you quit using DXM as quickly as possible if you are
using it on a daily basis.</P>

<P>If you have access to mental health services I strongly suggest
you seek them out. Many areas provide financial assistance for
uninsured or low-income patients. DXM addiction can be treated like
addiction to any other dissociative, i.e., PCP or ketamine.
Unfortunately, many physicians and psychiatrists are not generally
up-to-date on dissociative addiction, so you may need to look
around.</P>

<P>The biggest problem with DXM addiction is rebound depression. Many
casual DXM users have noticed a slight depression during the hangover
phase. With regular use, however, the brain becomes tolerant to
certain aspects of the DXM experience (probably a reregulation of
serotonin receptors due to the DXM-induced serotonin release). To
compensate for the depression (which can be severe) many people turn
back to DXM. Unfortunately, dissociatives make poor antidepressants,
since they have numerous side effects.</P>

<P>Incidentally, keep in mind that dissociative-induced depression is
often severe enough to result in impaired mental functioning. Many
cases of dissociative "brain damage" turn out not to be permanent
after all, but only the consequences of major depression.</P>

<P>If you choose to kick the habit on your own, or if you have no
other choice, you have two options: <I>build-down</I> and <I>cold
turkey</I>. Build-down means that you slowly taper off DXM use in the
hope that your brain will readjust as you do so, and thus avoid the
potentially severe depression of sudden withdrawal. Cold turkey
withdrawal (the term comes from the gooseflesh of heroin withdrawal)
means stopping suddenly.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.8.1 &nbsp; Preparing to Quit</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The first and most important step in either case is wanting to quit.
Not merely knowing you should, but actually wanting to. Take a good,
hard look at your life. Talk to your friends about your problem -- I
know it can be hard to do, but they probably already know it anyway.
Examine your performance at work or school. And look at your own use
patterns -- are you using DXM as a group activity, or are you using
it alone? Take stock of your finances. All of these factors can help
to contribute towards the desire to quit DXM.</P>

<P>Keep in mind that you may have to quit DXM permanently, and never
use it again. By the time most people has become addicted to DXM,
however, they tend to derive little or no pleasure from the
experience anyway. So you must be prepared for the thought of never
using DXM again, or at least waiting a year or two and before trying
it again. Remember, though, there are other psychedelics out there,
and many of the more interesting effects of DXM can be achieved
through transcendental meditation, yoga, and other spiritual
work.</P>

<P>In preparation for quitting any drug, get rid of anything and
everything that acts as a "trigger" for DXM use. Let your friends who
use DXM know you are trying to quit. You don't have to shun them
completely, but you might be well-advised to avoid them while they
are using or discussing DXM. Discard any supplies of DXM you have (if
you are quitting cold- turkey). Don't go to the drugstore without
someone else to watch over you. Don't go to places where you
traditionally used DXM (this is hard if you used it at home). If you
will be moving soon, you can use the move as an opportunity to leave
behind all the sensory triggers that made you think about DXM.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.8.2 &nbsp; Quitting "Cold Turkey"</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The safest way to quit from a neurological standpoint is to quit cold
turkey -- completely and suddenly. This is also the most difficult.
The depression stage can last for several weeks, even months.
Fortunately, it is treatable with drugs; SSRIs such as fluoxetine
(Prozac) have been used with great success in treating PCP addiction,
although there is some evidence that serotonin/dopamine reuptake
inhibitors, or combining a SSRI with a dopamine reuptake inhibitor
such as bupropion (Wellbutrin), may be preferrable. In drug-resistant
cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or the newer (and safer)
variant, left-prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation, have been
used as well. In any event, it is important to see a psychiatrist who
can assist you, give you a neurological evaluation, and prescribe any
necessary drugs. <B>DO NOT</B> use DXM after you are placed on
antidepressants of any kind.</P>

<P>If you do not have access to psychiatric medicine, you still have
other options. Try to vary your daily routine to expose yourself to
new and interesting stimuli. As corny as it seems, taking long walks
in the woods and, especially, getting a lot of sunlight, has helped
many people (and there may be some evidence that DXM-induced
depression may be in part due to a disruption of the circadian
rhythm, similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder). Keep a regular,
rigid schedule of getting up and going to bed at the same time. Some
people have had success using melatonin to help them stay on schedule
but there is some evidence that melatonin may worsen depression in
susceptible individuals. And the most important thing you can do is
to get regular physical exercise! Not only does it help with
depression, it also helps to get your body and brain back in top
working order.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.6.8.3"></A></CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>6.8.3 &nbsp; Build-Down</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Build-down is a controversial method for dealing with addiction. Many
people with whom I've spoken have used build-down successfully, but
many others tried it and failed. At the very least you can try it
first and then, if that doesn't work, try cold-turkey withdrawal
(which may be easier after you have cut down DXM use).</P>

<P>There are two conflicting issues here. On the one hand,
maintaining a regular, even dose of any drug can prevent the "rush"
that so many people find contributes to the addictiveness of the
drug. On the other hand, regular use of DXM can become dangerous to
the brain. Weighing these issues, and on the basis of those who have
used build-down successfully, I believe that a regular <B>low</B>
dose of DXM may be appropriate for build-down. Fortunately, even a
lower dose of DXM seems to help fight off dissociative
depression.</P>

<P>I do not claim to be a physician and I can only relay to you what
others have told me. Before attempting build-down you <B>must</B>
consult a medical authority, and at the very least have your serum
bromide level checked (or check anion gap, which amounts to the same
thing) to see if you are already in danger or bromide poisoning.
Assuming you check out OK, and your physician is willing to let you
try build-down, here is what I have been told from successful
build-down attempts. <B>THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS MEDICAL ADVICE, ONLY
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE FROM FORMER DXM USERS</B>.</P>

<P>First off, get someone else to help you -- a friend, spouse,
whatever. You want to make sure they will keep you on the rigorous
schedule and not let you go back to using large amounts of DXM.</P>

<P>The key to this method, according to those who have used it
successfully, is to place yourself on a regular, low dose of DXM --
just enough to keep the depression from becoming severe. First off,
wait at least three days from your last DXM dose before starting the
build-down; this should allow your body to clear out any DXM and
metabolites. Also, make sure you are not on any drug which can alter
DXM metabolism -- including antidepressants.</P>

<P>The build-down dose is taken three times per day at rigid six hour
intervals, and an individual dose should <B>not</B> be enough to get
you high. One person successfully used 30mg 3/day; most however have
used 60mg 3/day. It would probably be better to start at 30mg 3/day
and then move up, if that isn't working, after two or thee days.</P>

<P>After establishing the maintenance dose, build-down users
continued this dose for one to two weeks, before halving the dose.
Again, after another one to two weeks, the dose was halved again;
finally, when the total daily dose was less than 45mg, they went to
twice a day for one week, then once a day for one week, and then quit
completely.</P>

<P>All of the people who built down experienced mild depression,
although most found it manageable, and some told me that the ideas
suggested above in <A HREF="#toc.6.8.2">Section 6.8.2</A> (exercise,
walks in the woods, sunlight, regular sleep habits, etc.) helped to
make them feel better.</P>

<P>Again, remember, I'm only conveying anecdotal information here;
you <B>absolutely must</B> work with a physician or counselor who can
give you the professional help you need. For all I know, these people
who told me their successes could be unique in some way (or for that
matter they could be lying to me).</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.8.4 &nbsp; After Quitting: When Can I Use DXM
Again?</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Possibly never. Like any other severe addiction, there is always the
risk of a relapse. If you choose to throw caution to the wind, that's
your choice and you do it with the understanding of the risks
involved. The only suggestion I can give you is to limit DXM use to
one particular environment, and make sure it's an environment you do
not encounter when not using DXM. Basically, by making it into an
isolated ritual, you lessen the chances of normal sensory cues
leading you back into addiction. One former DXM addict managed to use
DXM again without becoming addicted after two years of being
drug-free; he did so by only using it with a select group of people,
in one particular place, and then one of his friends was responsible
for giving him his dose in a particular cup (thus avoiding the
sensory cue of the cough syrup bottle).</P>

<P>Still, it's better to find other ways of feeling good. Yoga and
meditation are probably the two best means of achieving altered
states of consciousness that are similar to DXM (unfortunately,
unlike DXM, they require hard work and patience). If you live
somewhere where serotonergic psychedelics (mushrooms, LSD, 2CB, etc)
are legal, you may find that these can give you the psychedelic
consciousness without the addictiveness (or danger of neurological
damage) that come with DXM.</P>

<P>Best of luck, and remember, above all, seek professional help. I
am not a physician, only a researcher, and I cannot and will not
claim to give advice for your particular case. There are too many
other factors which I do not know, and cannot understand, as I have
limited medical knowledge in areas other than neuroscience.</P>

<H2><CENTER>6.9 &nbsp; DXM Hangovers -- Avoiding and
Alleviating</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
Hangovers from DXM trips are not common at lower dosage ranges (first
and second plateau). Instead, many people report feeling energetic
and refreshed the next day, although it seems that getting enough
sleep is important here.</P>

<P>At higher dosage levels (third and fourth plateau), hangovers are
more frequent. Hangover effects reported consist of lethargy,
sleepiness, amotivation, mild sensory dissociation, muscle rigidity,
muscle tics (especially in the jaw and hands), dizziness, loss of
balance, headache, photophobia, and sharply diminished sense of
taste. Some people say that everything tastes like slightly salty
tepid water, or like MSG (monosodium glutamate, the flavor enhancer).
Note that you're very unlikely to get all, or even most, of these
symptoms.</P>

<P>Some of the hangover effect from high dosage trips is probably due
to residual DXM or dextrorphan, especially in individuals who lack
P450-2D6, or in whom it is inhibited (e.g., by fluoxetine). To my
knowledge there doesn't seem to be any way to speed up the
metabolism; the best I can suggest is to exercise, drink plenty of
water, take a multivitamin every day (don't overdo it, one is plenty)
and possibly a <B>small</B> iron supplement (which just might
increase cytochrome turnover), get enough sleep, and eat right.
<B>Don't</B> take too much iron; iron is very toxic.</P>

<P>Other hangover effects may be due to neurotransmitter depletion
(due to induction of 5HT and dopamine release), temporary
inactivation of NMDA receptors (I doubt it, but there's been
speculation), or just plain lack of sleep. Again, treating your body
well is probably the best you can do.</P>

<P>Finally, there is evidence that, for 24 to 48 hours following use
of a dissociative, certain parts of the brain are underactive
(probably due to neurotransmitter depletion) (<A HREF="refs.html#r322">322</A>).
There's not much you can do except tough it out. Obviously, you
shouldn't use DXM unless you have a day to recover.</P>

<P>Preventing hangovers may be possible to some degree. Certainly,
make sure you are in good physical condition to start with, and don't
try to stay up too late during your trip. Drink plenty of fluids (it
is possible to get dehydrated; this can slow down the kidneys), and
<B>don't</B> mix DXM with anything that could further deplete
neurotransmitters (e.g., amphetamines, MDMA, etc.). Try to avoid
going to sleep while still tripping hard - it seems to reduce the
quality of sleep. Eat something before you go to sleep; usually DXM
kills the appetite, so you may not know your body needs food.</P>

<P>Another possibility is the use of nootropics ("Smart Drugs") to
help prevent and alleviate hangovers. A good place to start for
information is alt.psychoactives (although, like any source on the
Internet, take any information with a grain of salt and ask for
medical journal references); another good place is Dean and
Morganthaler's text on the subject. A healthy dose of skepticism is
probably a good idea here; some of it might be placebo effect.
There's evidence for and against; check Medline if you're interested.
Note that unless otherwise specified, everything I mention should be
available at health-food or mail-order vitamin suppliers (this is
USA; I don't know about other countries).</P>

<P>Several people have reported beneficial effects from cholinergics,
specifically choline (the precursor to acetylcholine), and DMAE (also
a precursor, and a choline oxidase inhibitor). In both cases the
bitartrate salt seems to be the usual (there is a liquid DMAE
para-aminobenzoic acid formulation that tastes nasty and evidently
doesn't work). Note that some people with depression, primarily
endogenous, react very poorly to cholinergics. Also note that they
can make you really, really irritable if you're susceptible. Regular
use of DMAE seems to be the most effective, although that's something
that you have to build up for a couple of weeks (Dean and
Morganthaler suggest around 800mg per day in divided doses).</P>

<P>One-time use of DMAE or choline immediately before, during, or
after the trip has also been reported to work, (in that order of
preference), although not as well. Recommendations given to me have
been 800mg DMAE, or 1500mg choline; in either case with 350mg vitamin
B-5 (pantothenic acid) which acts as the relevant cofactor here.
Don't go much above that.</P>

<P>There is some preliminary evidence that supplementary tyrosine
(the precursor to dopamine and noradrenaline) may actually be useful
in the case of dopamine depletion. Normally, the rate-limiting enzyme
in the process is nearly saturated, so boosting tyrosine doesn't
work. It's hypothesized that more enzyme may be produced in response
to dopamine depletion. Furthermore, sigma activity may enhance
synthesis of dopamine (<A HREF="refs.html#r114">114</A>), so taking
supplemental tyrosine is even more likely to be a good idea.</P>

<P>A side note ... for whatever reason, nootropics fans seem to be
abnormally fond of using phenylalanine instead of tyrosine.
Phenylalanine does convert to tyrosine, but it's a very slow, limited
conversion, and there's no good reason for choosing phenylalanine
over tyrosine.</P>

<P>Vasopressin might also be useful; it seems to have a fair amount
of success in combating intoxicants, possibly by affecting long-term
potentiation (how I don't know). It's prescription in the USA, and it
does have side effects.</P>

<P>One final note - <B>do not take tryptophan!</B> Although this
isn't established, it's possible that NMDA receptors may be
upregulated after a DXM trip (especially in chronic users).
Tryptophan, in addition to leading to 5HT, also leads (along a much
more efficient pathway) to a substance called quinolinic acid, which
is very toxic to neurons, and acts via NMDA receptors.</P>

<H2><CENTER>6.10 &nbsp; How Toxic is DXM, and What is the Lethal
Dose?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
The LD<SUB>50</SUB> (dose at which 50% of animals die) of DXM doesn't
seem to be well known. For a variety of reasons, animal assays of the
lethal dose of psychoactives aren't always accurate. Nor have I ever
found a published LD<SUB>50</SUB> for DXM. So instead, I've decided
to go on the basis of the few deaths that have occurred from DXM use,
keeping in mind the amount of DXM people regularly consume for
recreational purposes.</P>

<P>In searching medical literature, I found only two cases of death
associated with DXM use, both in Sweden. In one case, a girl was
found dead in a public bathroom with two bottles of 30mg DXM tablets
(the number of tablets is believed to be 50/bottle, but may be 15 or
25). She had previously tried to commit suicide using a bottle of 50
tablets (this leads me to believe that she had, in fact, taken 100
tablets, for a total dose of 3000mg).</P>

<P>The other case involved a 27 year old man, and few details were
specified. In both cases, death was apparently due to inhibition of
respiration. Plasma levels of DXM were 9.2 and 3.3 micrograms per
gram (cases 1 and 2); plasma levels of dextrorphan were 2.9 and 1.5
micrograms per gram. Liver levels of DXM were about an order of
magnitude higher. In both cases, the ratio of DXM to dextrorphan was
about 3 (<A HREF="refs.html#r9">9</A>).</P>

<P>On the other hand, a dosage of 42mg/kg/day has been used (<I>with
respiratory support</I>) in children (<A HREF="refs.html#r33">33</A>),
which would be 2500 to 3000mg for a 60-70kg adult. There is also a
very low incidence of death associated with DXM use. Since a 42mg/kg
dose in an adult may be stronger than the equivalent dose in a child
(I have no reason to believe this, but it is possible), caution is
advisable in taking this as an indication of safety.</P>

<P>The highest daily dose of DXM I've come across is from a case
study of a 23-year old male (<A HREF="refs.html#r132">132</A>). His
daily dose was 3 to 4 12oz bottles of Robitussin
DM<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, for a total of 2160mg
(31mg/kg) to 2880mg (41mg/kg). He was, of course, considerably
addicted to DXM, and had built up this dose over a long period of
time.</P>

<P>It is reasonable to expect, given the data, and the available data
on the effects of high DXM doses, that DXM starts becoming toxic
around 25 to 30 mg/kg (about 1700-2000mg for adult of 150lb). This
corresponds to between 5 and 6 4oz bottles of 3mg/ml cough syrup,
i.e., a fairly large amount, but still within the realm of hardcore
experimenters. Keep this in mind before you consider large doses. IV
naloxone is considered the antidote for DXM overdose (<A HREF="refs.html#r54">54</A>),
even though DXM isn't an opiate.</P>

<P>Note that since publishing the FAQ, I have heard anecdotally (but
have not verified) of a few recent (non-fatal) overdoses in
Australia, and one fatality in the United States. The latter involved
long-term regular use and may have involved a buildup of DXM in the
bloodstream. Nine additional fatalities involving combined use of DXM
and zipeprol in Korea have been documented (<A HREF="refs.html#r367">367</A>).</P>

<H2><CENTER>6.11 &nbsp; Do You Recommend DXM for Recreational
Use?</CENTER></H2>

<P><BR>
No. Definitely not. Use of medicine, OTC or not, contrary to
instructions may be a violation of local, state, and/or federal law.
I hereby specifically tell you not to use any DXM-containing product
(or any other product) in a manner inconsistent with its
labeling.</P>

<P>Even if DXM were legal for recreational use, I still wouldn't
recommend it for frequent use, nor for high-dosage use. Frequent use
may bring about undesirable changes as mentioned above. High-dosage
use carries with it all the risks of any hallucinogen, and can be
distinctly unpleasant. Very little is known about sigma, PCP, or NMDA
receptors. You dork with them at your own risk, and that risk may be
considerable.</P>

<P>To be honest, part of my answer is covering my ass, and part is
genuine caution. DXM probably isn't quite as friendly as I used to
think it was, and there's no need to place onesself in harm's way for
the sake of a buzz. If you're just looking to get generically "high",
there are better highs out there (unless you really happen to be
drawn to dissociatives, and if so, believe me, you have my
sympathies). So make sure you really want to do DXM before you do it.
It's not a substitute for LSD or marijauana and shouldn't be used as
one.</P>

<P>Once more, I officially instruct you not to do DXM, or any other
drug, unless under the guidance of a physician. Right now, in the
USA, there are many people with nothing better to do than support
legal paternalism and legal moralism. For whatever reason, some
people feel that they have the right to tell a legal adult what she
or he can and cannot do that involves only her/his body. And as long
as this goes on, I'm going to make sure I'm not thrown into prison so
they can free murderers and rapists to make room for me. So, I'm
telling you - don't break the law.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.1 &nbsp; Itching (the "Robo Itch")</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Some people get the itch, some don't. Among those who do, some seem
to get it from the DXM itself, some from the dyes in cough syrups (in
particular tartrazine), and some just as a consequence of losing
tactile sensation.</P>

<P>In any case, from all reports the best thing seems to be to wait
for it to go away, and try to think about something else. Scratching
is OK, so long as you don't injure yourself in the process (remember,
you many not be feeling pain as you normally would). A loofah can be
quite enjoyable, actually, should you feel the urge to take a bath
(which evidently can itself be enjoyable on DXM. Just be careful!)
You can try a topical antihistamine spray, but I doubt it will do any
good. An oral antihistamine (remember, never take non-drowsy
antihistamines like Seldane<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> with
DXM!) is also reported to work without adverse effects.</P>

<P>If the itch is accompanied by a rash, swelling, or other symptoms
of an allergic reaction, you should definitely take an oral
antihistamine (not a prescription one), and make sure there is
someone with you. If the allergic reaction continues, or you feel you
may be going into shock, get to a hospital. To my knowledge this type
of allergic reaction has never occurred on DXM.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.2 &nbsp; Fast Heartbeat</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Many times this is more a problem of perception than anything else.
Still, it does happen. As far as I have been able to determine, DXM
itself can raise the heart rate somewhat, about as much as a mild to
moderate stimulant (e.g. a few cups of coffee to a "coffee virgin").
Reports have indicated a range of 90 to 120 beats per minute as the
relevant range.</P>

<P>Try to have someone sober take your pulse, since you may be
getting sensory echoes. If your heart rate is truly high (as a
general but probably inadequate guideline, above 120 beats per
minute), do your best to relax, stay calm, and see if it goes down
with relaxation (and see <A HREF="#toc.6.12.3">Section 6.12.3</A>
below if relevant). If you continue to have an abnormally fast
heartbeat, by all means see a doctor. You probably aren't in much
danger, but there's no need to take the risk.</P>

<P>Prolonged very fast heartbeat, or fast heartbeat accompanied by
chest pain or tightness, should be taken seriously and may be cause
for medical attention (note that a panic attack can also cause a
feeling of chest tightness). If in doubt, go to the hospital. People
with existing heart problems should avoid recreational DXM use.
Incidentally, neither of the recorded deaths due to DXM overdose were
attributed to heart failure (respiratory failure was considered the
cause).</P>

Panic attacks can occur on DXM, especially in naive users or users
rushing in to higher doses. A panic attack can increase the heart
rate significantly, sometimes as high as 200 beats per minute!
Unfortunately, panic attacks can be hard to control; the best thing
to do seems to be to try to relax, go somewhere you feel comfortable,
and focus on your environment. A panic attack is a positive feedback
situation; once you start having one, the symptoms themselves can
feed the fear. Breaking this vicious cycle can be difficult. If you
are predisposed to panic attacks you should probably avoid DXM in the
first place.</P>

Heartbeats</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>An irregular heartbeat, like a fast heartbeat, may be a problem of
perception more than anything else. Remember that, especially at
higher doses, there can be a "sensory echo" effect which may
influence your measurements.</P>

<P>An occasional feeling that your heart "skipped a beat" is usually
not cause for worry. Sometimes it is due to spasms of the esophagus,
stomach, or bronchial tubes and has nothing to do with the heart;
it's hard to distinguish sensations among internal organs. More
frequent heart irregularity, or irregularity with chest pain, may
require medical attention. Go to the hospital if in doubt.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.5 &nbsp; Nausea, Vomiting, Gas, and
Diarrhea</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Ah, the joys of ingesting large amounts of thickening agents. Nausea
is to be expected, especially with cough syrups. It usually goes
away. A few people have reported that meclizine (available in several
brands of over-the-counter anti-nausea medicine) can help without
adversely affecting the DXM experience. In general, though, most
anti-nausea drugs are anticholinergics and/or CNS depressants,
neither one of which you want to mix with DXM. The best response
seems to be to tough it out, or switch to gel-caps. Incidentally,
avoid taking DXM with greasy or heavy foods.</P>

<P>Vomiting occasionally occurs, usually for the same reason as
nausea. Again, not much to worry about. If you do vomit, just make
sure to drink lots of water to replace what you just lost. Both
guaifenesin and large amounts of alcohol tend to contribute to the
tendency to vomit.</P>

<P>Gas and diarrhea, especially after the trip, are also fairly
common with syrups. Not much to do, unfortunately; just tough it out
and drink water. Loperamide
(Immodium<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>) can help with
intestinal cramps and diarrhea, and from all reports doesn't affect
the brain at all.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.6 &nbsp; Unconsciousness</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
This is mostly advice for the designated sober person; obviously it
won't do you much good if you're unconscious. Unconsciousness with
DXM is to my knowledge extremely rare (I've heard of it happening
once). Please keep in mind that it is possible to achieve a fully
anaesthetic dose of DXM, but if you do so you risk serious injury,
and probably won't remember much of the experience. There are
probably a few psychonauts out there with the experience (and the
assistance of physicians) to handle voluntary anaesthesia, but let's
leave that to the professionals and the truly insane.</P>

<P>Generally if someone passes out, the first thing to do is make
sure they don't fall and hit their head. Yes, DXM may protect brain
cells somewhat from the effects of head trauma, but let's not try out
that theory ourselves. Make sure the unconscious person is lying down
with their feet elevated, and that someone (sober) is with them. If
you feel there is any danger of vomiting, roll the person onto his or
her side.</P>

<P>There are several reasons why a person on DXM might be, or appear,
unconscious. Most commonly, he or she may be in an imaginary dream
world, unresponsive to the physical world. He or she may have fainted
due to postural hypotension (which I've heard of happening with DXM).
Or they may just be ignoring you.</P>

<P>Whatever the reason, try and get a response from the unconscious
person. If you can't get any response after a minute or so, it's time
to call an ambulance. See <A HREF="#toc.6.12.7">Section
6.12.7</A>.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.7 &nbsp; Overdose</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
The first thing to do in the case of a suspected overdose is to call
an ambulance. Don't argue, don't hesitate, and don't worry about the
legal implications; you can work that out later. Remain calm;
freaking out won't help anyone. If they are unfamiliar with DXM
overdoses, tell them to bring a syringe of naloxone. If you receive
instructions from the medical authorities, follow them.</P>

<P>Check the individual's breathing and pulse. You may need to apply
CPR if the heart has stopped (again, follow any instructions the
emergency personnel give you). Try to find out exactly how much DXM
he or she took, and at what time. Also find out if he or she was
taking any other drugs (legal or not), notably including
antidepressants, prescription antihistamines, sedatives, or
alcohol.</P>

<P>Really, at this point, you need competent medical advice, and I'm
not a physician. Unfortunately, as more than one physician has told
me, the medical community is generally ignorant about DXM. Given
this, I'm going to try to outline below as much as I can that might
be relevant about DXM in an emergency, with the understanding that
someone with medical knowledge will evaluate the situation.</P>

<P>When dealing with a DXM overdose it is important to remember that
there are really two drugs at work: DXM and its metabolite,
dextorphan. At overdose levels, the conversion enzyme (CYP-2D6) will
probably be saturated, so even after gastric lavage and activated
charcoal, DXM will continue to be converted to dextrorphan (DXO),
probably raising serum DXO levels. Also, since DXM is usually found
as the hydrobromide, you may have to worry about acute bromide
toxicity.</P>

<P>DXO is in the same class as ketamine and PCP, and from all
accounts can be treated as such. DXM has additional pharmacological
activity; it is a calcium (and possibly sodium) channel blocker and a
mild noncompetative dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Like PCP, DXM may
cause hypertension and CVAs (though if it's any consolation the NMDA
blockade should minimize the damage). There is also the possibility
for serotonin syndrome if DXM has been combined with a serotonergic.
Rhabdomyolysis has never been observed with DXM but is possible.</P>

<P>I have no data on whether acidifying the urine will hasten DXM
clearance. Nor do I know whether DXM (or DXO) may reappear in bile,
though I have heard several anecdotal reports of increased bile
secretion during DXM use.</P>

<P>Finally, remember that, like PCP, DXM can cause emergence
phenomena. Once the individual regains consciousness he or she will
probably be confused, and possibly paranoid and hostile. Also like
PCP, DXM can impair perception of pain. Although I've never heard of
it happening, it's possible that someone coming out of a DXM overdose
could become violent.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.8 &nbsp; High Temperature / Fever</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
First, make sure you actually have a fever. DXM can mess with your
sense of temperature. On the other hand, I have received one report
of DXM-induced hyperthermia that could have been dangerous. A
temperature at or above 102 F (39 C) is entering the danger zone. If
this happens to you (or someone you are with), the best way to cool
down is by taking a cool bath or shower (make sure it feels cool to a
normal person!), and drinking cold water. Incidentally, speaking from
personal experience (with the flu, not DXM), the "cool" water will
feel damn cold.</P>

<P>In the case of a fever at or above 105 F (40.5 C) you've got a
real emergency on your hands. Immediately contact a doctor or
hospital, and try to reduce the body temperature as quickly as
possible. Ice-water baths are acceptable providing there is someone
(sober) there to make sure the person doesn't go into shock and
drown. Expect to hear a lot of screaming; this is a significantly
unpleasant experience even without a fever.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.9 &nbsp; Shortness of Breath / Breathing
Problems</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Again this is usually a perception problem, and sometimes is related
to panic attacks. There is also evidence that dissociative
anesthetics in general cause a transient feeling of shortness of
breath, possibly because the body is beginning to "take over"
breathing from conscious control. Take deep, even, and slow breaths;
hyperventilating won't help, and can make you feel even worse. It
should clear up by itself. In the case of hyperventilation, the
"breathing into a paper bag" trick really does work, by increasing
blood CO2 levels.</P>

If you start feeling like you are choking on your tongue, make sure
someone can assist you, or call a doctor if you believe you really
are choking. There is actually very little danger of choking on your
tongue; it's pretty much physically impossible. Nonetheless it can
seem frightening.</P>

<P>If you are in the position of trying to assist someone in this
situation, open the person's mouth, tilt their head back slightly,
and grasp and hold their tongue out of the way of their airway until
they feel better. Avoid putting anything in their mouth; this could
easily fall in and make things much worse.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.11 &nbsp; Nosebleeds</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
DXM can occasionally dry out your sinuses (an anticholinergic
effect), so check first to see if your nosebleed is a result of nasal
irritation. If so, treat it like you'd treat any other nosebleed.</P>

<P>If in doubt, or if you notice a prolonged nosebleed, burst
capillaries in the eyes or face, headache, or a sudden impairment of
mental or motor skills (hard to determine on DXM, I know), get
medical help. I'm not familiar with any cases of DXM-induced
hypertensive CVAs, although it might be possible, especially when
mixed with stimulants or MAOIs.</P>

<P>A suggestion was made to me from a physician that I'm going to
pass along. If you're going to be doing any sort of recreational
drugs which carry a risk of hypertension, you may wish to purchase a
sphygmomanometer (that blood pressure measuring gadget). They aren't
terribly expensive, and they can warn you when you're starting to get
into dangerous territory.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.12 &nbsp; Feeling "dead" / losing one's

Remember, DXM at high levels can be very dissociative. You're not
dead, you just can't feel your body right now. This state can have a
lot in common with certain lucid dream states. A feeling of "being
dead" is common with third and fourth plateau DXM doses. The best
thing seems to be to try to make contact with some part of your body
(this can take a lot of effort), to reassure you that you're still
there. Then, relax and enjoy your trip.</P>

<P>This is another reason why you should have a sober person with
you. If you are in any real danger, he or she should take care of
you.</P>

Hangovers can occur from higher doses. Usually you can expect to feel
very relaxed if not lethargic for the next day after a heavy trip.
You may also might experience dizziness, muscle rigidity, loss of
balance, slight double-vision, and a general feeling of being "not
all there". Again, it goes away. Sleep seems to improve things a
great deal. Make sure to drink a lot of liquids, get plenty of rest,
take a multivitamin, and exercise. As DXM is metabolized differently
in different people, some may experience hangovers (and trips) a lot
longer than others; some have had three-day trips and week-long
hangovers. For more details, see <A HREF="#toc.6.1.7">Section

<H3><CENTER>6.12.14 &nbsp; Prolonged Dissociation From the Real
World</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
Very rarely, someone will come out of a DXM trip and seem to be very
dissociated from the real world, behaving a little like a robot.
Whenever this has been reported to me, the person in question had
always taken a high (third to fourth plateau) dose, and in most cases
had tried to achieve an out-of-body state (draw your own
conclusions). Make sure the person is relaxed, and try to engage him
or her in a familiar activity. Familiar environmental cues should go
a long way towards bringing him or her back to the "real world". Also
keep in mind that the person may be slow to metabolize DXM and thus
still be tripping.</P>

<P>If, after a couple of days, the person still hasn't returned to
normal, it's time to get worried. Contact your nearest psychologist,
priest, shaman, or other equivalent. Note that I don't think there's
any biological reason for this to happen.</P>

<P>Some papers on PCP have suggested that PCP can cause transient
psychotic breaks in susceptible individuals which can last up to ten
days. Hospitalization is recommended for the safety both of the
patient and of others. I've never heard of anything like this with
DXM but it could happen. This problem seems to resolve itself with or
without psychiatric intervention. After returning to normal, the
person may not remember the trip or a few days after it (<A HREF="refs.html#r355">355</A>).</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.15 &nbsp; Serotonin Syndrome</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
It's not generally a good idea to diagnose yourself, and I'm hesitant
to list in this section a diagnosis rather than symptoms. On the
other hand, serotonin syndrome is, at least at the time I'm writing
this, relatively unknown and probably underreported. And with
increasing numbers of people taking SSRIs like
Prozac<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, the potential for
serotonin syndrome among users of DXM is rising.</P>

<P>The symptoms of serotonin syndrome are specified above (see
<A HREF="#toc.6.2.9">Section 6.2.9</A>). Keep in mind that generally
speaking anyone on DXM will experience some of those symptoms, so
don't freak out. The point is, if you start noticing said symptoms
when you aren't on DXM, or if they are considerably stronger than
usual, you might have a problem.</P>

<P>Don't panic. Serotonin syndrome is rarely fatal; usually it's just
an indication that you need to stop taking so many serotonergic
drugs. There are specific treatments for it (antiserotonergic drugs,
appropriately enough), and most of the symptoms respond adequately to
benzodiazepines.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.16 &nbsp; Bad Trips</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
First off, let me distinguish between a bad trip and a true psychotic
break. Here's an example. If you feel like your ego is dissolving
into a puddle of jelly and you're suddenly confronted with
frightening memories and images, that's a bad trip. If you believe
the aliens have implanted a homing beacon in your brain and you have
to drill a hole in your skull to let it out, that's a psychotic
break. Generally speaking if you're having a bad trip, you still know
you're on drugs. If you have a psychotic break, you probably
don't.</P>

<P>The most important thing, and it seems trivial, is to remember
that it's all in your mind. Your own mind is generating your
experiences, and nothing in there can truly harm you. Make sure you
are in a quiet, calm place, with limited sensory stimuli. If you find
yourself having severe Lilliputian hallucinations (i.e., everything
seems the wrong size, either too big or too small, or both), keep
your eyes open and focus on a familiar object that will give you a
size reference.</P>

<P>If things seem to be getting worse, consider a <I>light</I>
sedative, such as as beer or two. Clinically, benzodiazepines have
shown great utility in terminating dissociative trips, but I <B>do
not</B> recommend using them except under the guidance of a
physician. If you do use them, prepare to slam into a "psychic wall"
since the experience of suddenly stopping the trip can be unpleasant,
to say the least. Incidentally, by "psychic" I mean the effects of
psychedelics on the psyche (mind and consciousness), not anything
paranormal or spiritual.</P>

<P>Finally, try to keep a sense of humor about the whole thing. You
aren't generally in any danger from DXM (unless you've taken way too
much, in which case you should get yourself to the hospital), and it
will end.</P>

<H3><CENTER>6.12.17 &nbsp; Psychotic Breaks</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
This section is probably of no use to you if you're the one
experiencing the psychotic break, and is primarily intended for
trip-sitters. First verify that the tripper is actually out of his
gourd and not just playing games (incidentally, this is a good reason
to use a "safeword" when tripping; when the safeword is spoken, take
everything seriously until further notice). Delusions on DXM,
especially upper plateaus, are common and not usually something to
worry about since people aren't usually motivated to act upon
them.</P>

<P>If you've got a real problem on your hands, call the hospital and
explain the situation. Again, since DXM isn't a commonly known drug,
you can tell them it's similar to ketamine and PCP (an
oversimplification, I know). Be very careful in trying to restrain
the tripper, since she or he may perceive this as a threat, and will
probably be mostly immune to pain. Unless you can <I>safely</I>
restrain someone (and unless you've had training in this sort of
thing, you probably can't), the tripper, like a cornered animal,
could beat the living shit out of you without thinking twice.</P>

<P>Instead of restraint, try talking him or her down. Be calm,
soothing, and repeatedly remind the tripper that they have taken a
drug which has critically impaired their perceptions. Remind them of
who they are and how they got here, and that the experience will
end.</P>
