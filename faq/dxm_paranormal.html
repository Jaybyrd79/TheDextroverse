<P><FONT SIZE="+3"><B>8 &nbsp; Altered States and Paranormal
Experiences</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
Shortly after publishing version 3.0 of the FAQ I started getting
letters from people who were having what they believed to be psychic,
paranormal, or spiritual experiences on DXM. As time went on, the
number of these letters increased, and I received additional
information from psychonauts who have used ketamine in paranormal
investigations.</P>

<P>I gave a lot of thought to whether or not I should include this
information in the FAQ. People <I>have</I> asked me about DXM and
paranormal experiences, and in general my response has been, "you're
on drugs, it's all in your mind". Unfortunately that doesn't really
answer any questions, since people are obviously having these
experiences, whether they are delusional or not, and nobody seems to
have much idea why.</P>

<P>So I am going to attempt in this chapter to take an open-minded
but somewhat skeptical look at the possible relationship between DXM
(and other dissociatives) and paranormal experiences. It may surprise
you to know that there are very good reasons to suspect that
paranormal experiences may involve some of the same brain mechanisms
affected by DXM. Whether or not these paranormal experiences have any
validity outside of the human brain is entirely a question of faith,
and I won't try and make that decision for you.</P>

<P>I'm also using this chapter to discuss in more detail some of the
altered states of consciousness and experience that occur on DXM.
These are not in any sense paranormal, but they are interesting, and
discussion of them doesn't really fit anywhere else.</P>

<P>8.1 &nbsp; Preliminary Information and Discussion</P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
We live in an Age of Reason, where science and technology are viewed
as limitless in their ability to explain the world that we perceive.
And, living in this age, we like to believe that we are entirely
rational creatures, and that what we perceive can be explained in
simple, concrete terms.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, it just ain't so. Humans are fundamentally
irrational critters, and our conscious, rational minds are just a
thin veneer layered on top of complex, unconscious neural networks
which occasionally behave in bizarre ways. Many of us assume that our
conscious minds are in total control, logically formulating ideas and
thoughts, when in fact our inspirations, ideas, and impulses seem to
come from nowhere. In spite of adherence to conscious thought, much
research suggests that the brain works best when one doesn't try to
think too much; as an example, one study found that hunches were
considerably more accurate than the conscious mind in choosing among
stacked decks of cards.</P>

<P>The most blatant example of our unrepressed irrational side may be
the widespread phenomenon of UFO abductions. Thousands (perhaps tens
of thousands) of ordinarily rational people, most of whom have no
good reason to lie, report alien encounters ranging from viewing UFOs
to having been abducted, taken into spacecraft, and subjected to
experiments. While there is occasionally physical evidence that
<I>something</I> happened, many times there is solid evidence that
nothing physical was going on at all.</P>

<P>Interestingly enough, these experiences are nothing new. In the
1800's, people didn't see UFO's; instead, they saw floating ships
which travelled across the country. And before that, of course, were
faeries, elves, and other mythical creatures. Whatever they are, and
whether they exist outside of our minds or not, they seem to take on
a form appropriate to the society of the time. Many of the features
of the abductions stay the same, regardless of the symbols. A
detailed examination of these similarities is given in <I>Passport to
Magonia</I> (<A HREF="refs.html#r361">361</A>).</P>

<P>There are numerous explanations for these phenomena, but one thing
seems certain: for whatever reason, people <I>are</I> perceiving
them. Recent research by Persinger et al. suggests that
electromagnetic and geomagnetic fields, earth lights, and the like,
may capable of inducing eddy currents in the temporal lobe limbic
networks, resulting in all sorts of bizarre experiences (<A HREF="refs.html#r332">332</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r333">333</A>).
If you've been paying attention, you'll recall that DXM (like other
dissociatives) exerts some of its effects on these very same
networks.</P>

<P>There are still many questions to be answered, of course.
Researchers have constructed devices which induce these eddy currents
and can produce generic "vestibular" sensations, but these simple
sensations are nowhere near the complexity of the typical alien
encounter. A few have suggested that these "aliens" may be real in
some sense, not necessarily little green men in flying saucers, but
perhaps noncorporeal, electromagnetic entities. Other people tend to
look on those few as kooks.</P>

<P>So in any case, whether or not you believe in the <I>objective</I>
validity of the paranormal experience, it is hard to argue with the
<I>subjective</I> validity of it. DXM is capable of inducing a
variety of paranormal experiences, and even though it's probably "all
in your head", there's good reason to believe that non-drug-induced
paranormal events are also all in your head as well. Again, let me
point out that whether or not you believe these are real in some
objective sense is entirely a matter of faith and cannot, in general,
be proven or disproven scientifically.</P>

<P>8.2 &nbsp; What Paranormal and Altered State Experiences Occur on
DXM?</P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
Here is a detailed list of various paranormal, spiritual, or
otherwise altered states and experiences that can occur during the
use of DXM. Most of these tend to occur at the upper plateaus and at
Plateau Sigma, and many of them are very rarely reported.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.8.2.1"></A>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.2.1 &nbsp; The Dissociative
Spiral</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
The <I>Dissociative Spiral</I> is a term which I borrowed (and
modified) from Shulgin's <I>PiHKAL</I>. It describes a particular set
of characteristic sensations or internal states that seem to occur as
a result of some sort of abnormal temporal lobe functioning. In
<I>PiHKAL</I>, Ann Shulgin recounts how she would experience the
"Spiral" when she was younger, almost always right before going to
sleep. Many people have reported the very same set of effects on DXM
(and ketamine), and I suspect that people who experience it naturally
may have something interesting going on in the temporal lobes that
mimics the effects of dissociatives. Perhaps this is due to release
of endopsychosin, or perhaps it's just the way these people's brains
are wired. One person suggested it may be complex partial seizures,
but I don't think there's any evidence for that.</P>

<P>The Dissociative Spiral seems to have four phases, each phase
lasting a fixed amount of time. Not everyone experiences all phases.
I have given each phase a name which I think is descriptive based
primarily on the experiences of DXM users; I also suggest you consult
<I>PiHKAL</I> for Ann Shulgin's version.</P>

<P><B>Supernova</B>. Ann Shulgin refers to this as
"macrocosm-microcosm". There is a sensation that one's "core" is
rapidly shrinking, growing ever smaller and smaller, down to the size
of a subatomic particle. Accompanying this shrinking sensation is a
feeling of one's "outer shell" expanding equally rapidly, until it
fills the entire universe. This is generally considered as a pleasant
sensation, with a slight characteristic of free-fall.</P>

<P><B>Lilliputian Hallucinations</B>. After shrinking down to a
proton, the Lilliputian Hallucinations begin. Everything that one
imagines or recalls seems grossly distorted in size. Human figures
alternate between tall and thin and stretched out like taffy, and
shrunken and rounded. Many people see long, thin ribbons of
multicolored energy.<BR>
There is a disturbing sense of Infinity with these hallucinations.
Most find this phase extremely grating on the soul, mentally painful,
perhaps because one is perceiving objects to have totally opposite
characteristics at once. Some people are familar with Lilliputian
hallucinations from fevers.</P>

<P><B>Veils of Light and Darkness</B>. The third phase consists of
alternating visual fields of total, thick black and ghostly white or
greyish-white. Each visual field gives way to the opposite as if
veils were being torn and dissolved. The "black veil" is often
described as being much darker than ordinary darkness, since even the
phosphenes (the patterns one sees with eyes closed in the dark) are
absent. Most people also find this phase extremely unpleasant.</P>

<P><B>Contact</B>. The fourth phase, and the rarest, is also the most
spectacular. After passing through the last Veil, there is a sudden
sense of being in the presence of a profoundly powerful, loving,
intelligent entity (or occasionally, multiple entities). These
typically greet the individual with empathic communication, sending
messages of familiarity, joy, love, concern, and occasionally a vague
sense of humorous curiosity at finding a human being in this place.
This phase is the most profound, and the most pleasant.</P>

<P>To my knowledge nobody has ever done an EEG during the
Dissociative Spiral, but I have a hunch that the temporal lobes would
probably be doing something interesting. Perhaps this is a common
occurance, but one that most people are incapable of perceiving. In
any case, it is frequently observed with DXM, typically phases 1 and
2, occasionally phase 3, and rarely phase 4.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.2.2 &nbsp; Deja Vu and Other Memory
Mishaps</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
<I>Deja Vu</I>, the feeling that one has had the exact same
experiences before, is common both during and after the DXM trip.
Somewhat less common is <I>Jamais Vu</I>, the sensation of being in a
totally unfamiliar environment when one is not. Other memory mishaps,
such as recognizing unfamiliar objects or people as familiar, or
familiar ones as strange and unknown, also occur. All of these are
probably due to misfiring in the neural networks responsible for
recognizing and recalling sensory input.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.8.2.3"></A>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.2.3 &nbsp; Out-of-Body Experiences
(OOBEs)</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
<I>OOBEs</I> (Out-of-Body Experiences) are common at fourth plateau
doses. Typically these start with a sensation that one is being
tugged horizontally out of one's body, followed by a floating
sensation. Typically one enters what seems to be an entirely
different plane of existence, although rarely people report staying
in the physical world as a noncorporeal entity, viewing one's body
from above. The various alternate planes each have consistent
physical rules, life forms, and appearances.</P>

<P>Explaining OOBEs is difficult and is in my opinion currently
beyond neuroscience. The rational explanation is that these are
delusions, but if so, then they are delusions that we seem to be in
some sense programmed to experience in a consistent fashion. The one
explanation I have heard that seems to make sense is that one is
experiencing one's world (or more accurately, the internal model of
one's world) from a "third person" perspective, i.e., the "fly on the
wall" viewpoint that many people have when dreaming or recalling
memories. There may be some sort of built-in spatial transformation
that allows one to perceive (consciously or not) the world from an
outsider's perspective and observe one's own actions. It's possible
that the posterior cingulate cortex may be involved.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.2.4 &nbsp; Near-Death and Rebirth
Experiences</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
<I>Near-death experiences</I> (NDEs) are less common than OOBEs, and
also usually occur only on fourth plateau trips. Again this seems to
be something that we're wired to experience when the brain is
sufficiently disrupted, either by drugs or by lack of oxygen.
Following an NDE, and sometimes after a heavy upper plateau trip, one
may experience a profound sense of rebirth, a discontinuity in
memories as if one has begun life anew. This may be some sort of
state-dependent memory phenomenon.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.2.5 &nbsp; Contact with Alien and Spiritual
Beings</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
Many people report contact with alien and spiritual beings, deities,
and free-floating consciousnesses during upper plateau trips, notably
during out-of-body experiences and the dissociative spiral. It has
been suggested by Jaynes (<A HREF="refs.html#r350">350</A>),
Persinger (<A HREF="refs.html#r330">330-349</A>), and others that
these entities may be fragments of one's own subconscious mind that
one is suddenly perceiving consciously. Curiously enough, deities
seem to be more commonly female than male. I have no clue why this is
the case.</P>

<P>There is also a more complex dissociative effect involving a
unique, consistent set of beliefs about, for lack of a better term,
an alien conspiracy; see <A HREF="#toc.8.3">Section 8.3</A>
below.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.8.2.6"></A>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.2.6 &nbsp; Clairvoyance, ESP, and Other Psi
Phenomena</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
A few people have reported "Psi" phenomena such as ESP (extra-sensory
perception), clairvoyance (psychically seeing distant places), and
the like. Telekinesis doesn't seem to be reported, although a few
report that, while under the influence of DXM, they felt like they
could slightly influence the laws of probability. All of these can be
safely explained as simply drug-induced delusions, although there has
been to my knowledge no formal research on the subject.</P>

<P>It is possible that ESP and related phenomena (with DXM use or
without) exist but occur entirely randomly, or only when not being
observed critically. Since repeatability, and invariance under
observation, are the foundations of science, it may be that questions
about psychic phenomena will never yield entirely to science. At this
point it becomes a matter of faith.</P>

<P>One interesting factor which does differentiate ESP from other
paranormal phenomena is that while most paranormal experiences occur
more often during heavier geomagnetic activity, ESP occurs more often
during decreased geomagnetic activity (<A HREF="refs.html#r346">346</A>).
The true believers would probably argue that the geomagnetic field is
interfering with ESP; the skeptics would most likely suggest that
"ESP" is just a consequence of similar thought patterns leading to
similar conclusions, and that the geomagnetic field may be capable of
inducing noise into the system.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.2.7 &nbsp; Memory Loops and Prescient
Sensations</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
DXM can severely alter the sense of causality, and with upper plateau
and Plateau Sigma trips, one can lose one's sense of causality
completely. One person reported a sudden feeling that he was
contacting his own mind in the past, passing to himself the ideas and
insights he had experienced as a child. Another person felt such a
strong sense of deja vu, coupled with memory impairment, that he
believed he'd had a prescient dream of the current events. Such
occurrances are probably a consequence of the profound alterations of
memory and recognition networks. It's hard to describe how utterly
convincing these sensations can seem while under the influence of
dissociatives.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.8.2.8"></A>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.2.8 &nbsp; Dissociative Thought
Patterns</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
In the realm of altered states of consciousness, there are several
interesting patterns of thought that occur on DXM. Typically these
include a sense of deep understanding of highly abstract and often
multi-level abstract concepts. Examples include self-referential
statements ("this statement is false"), multi-level logic,
self-creating ideas (e.g., the concept of a self-creating,
self-invoking concept), and so one. One mathematics student was
suddenly able to intuitively understand Godel's Incompleteness
Theorem (this intuitive understanding persisted even after the DXM
wore off).</P>

<P>Most of these concepts are in some sense self-referential, and
seem to blend levels of abstraction that don't ordinarily go
together. My hunch is that DXM allows the mind to create and maintain
associations between increasingly far-fetched and unrelated concepts.
As a result, these little "nuggets" of self-referential thought,
which would ordinarily be discarded or never make it to
consciousness, bubble up into the conscious mind seemingly out of
nowhere.</P>

<CENTER><A NAME="toc.8.3"></A>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.3 &nbsp; Cosmic Coincidence Central and the
Alien Conspiracy</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
Everyone take a deep breath, we're about to jump off into the deep
end. Many people who have frequently used DXM or other dissociatives
begin to develop consistent contact with "aliens" (with all due
skepticism, these are probably elements of one's subconscious mind
that have taken on characteristics of independent consciousness).
Regardless of the cause, one particular subset of these aliens seem
to have surprisingly consistent behaviour and intentions. Here,
basically, is the message that can be pieced together from
dissociative users.</P>

<P>There are numerous groups of entities or aliens, but two in
particular are relevant. One group, the "helpful aliens", are
attempting to guide humankind towards societal and spiritual progress
with the ultimate intention that we become so far advanced that we
can leave behind the earth (and possibly the physical world), and
join a vast, intergalactic federation of other races. In order to
keep us from blowing ourselves up or slipping into societal chaos,
these helpful aliens do what they can to keep us on the right
track.</P>

<P>However, there are limits, either by some sort of convention or
law, or by the nature of noncorporeal existence, to what these aliens
can do. For example, they probably can't show up in big motherships
and announce peace on earth; they can't suddenly make all guns and
bombs disappear. They seem to be able to influence human progress
only by means that appear as coincidence, such as fortuitous events,
sudden insights and inspirations, luck, and that sort of thing. Some
people have suggested that these "helpful aliens" are bending some
sort of "law" by helping us out, and they can only do it as long as
it can't be absolutely proven that they interfered with out
progress.</P>

<P>Then there are the "not-so-helpful aliens". Not necessarily evil,
but totally unconcerned with our race, and unconvinced that we are
worth the trouble of helping. Some would say that they view us as we
view ants, and would have no qualms about exterminating us if they
felt it wise to do so. They too are restricted to operating primarily
through coincidence.</P>

<P>Anyone who has studied the belief systems and religions of the
world will of course notice that these sets of aliens are nothing
new. They are also angels and devils, good and evil spirits, and that
sort of thing. There is a great deal of correspondence with the
Seelie and Unseelie court of the faeries.</P>

<P>So we are left once again with a part of human consciousness that
we don't understand, that is profoundly irrational, and that keeps
stubbornly making itself known regardless of how much science and
reason we try to cling to. A lot of people have these experiences, on
drugs or not (or maybe the ones who aren't on drugs are connected to
an "inner pharmacist" of sorts, the secretion of chemicals like
endopsychosin which mimic the dissociatives).</P>

<P>Some people have developed surprisingly complex theories about
these aliens and their goals and methods. Sometimes the aliens give
their names. One person was contacted by an alien named Calsutmoran
who said he was from "very far away" (pers. comm.), and explained the
Cosmic Coincidence Theory. What is surprising is that someone else,
who had never heard this story, also reported contact with an alien
of the exact same name.</P>

<P>In conclusion, while I don't necessarily think we're pawns in some
weird game of the aliens or spirits, I do think there's a part of the
human mind that we don't understand, that may be receiving, and
transmitting, information in ways we do not recognize. This doesn't
necessarily require any ESP or other psychic powers; it could be as
simple as gestures, tone of voice, and other factors that we use in
communication that we are not directly aware of. I expect the next
decade or two will see some truly rigorous investigation of these
topics, and I eagerly await the results.</P>

Unless you suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy (see <A HREF="#toc.8.9">Section

always a psychological danger, and there have been cases of ketamine
users committing suicide after forming deep mystical belief systems

Explained</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
Okay, so why do people keep having these experiences? Where do these
spiritual entities and weird altered states come from? Could a simple
molecule be responsible for such a complex set of experiences, or is
the DXM molecule just a key that unlocks a hidden part of the brain?
Here I will summarize a few theories that I have run across
attempting to explain these phenomena.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.5.1 &nbsp; Temporal
Anomalies</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
The title is something of a pun, since many of these paranormal
experiences seem to involve curious twists of time and causality. But
the intended meaning is anomalies in the behaviour of temporal lobe
limbic networks: the hippocampus and surrounding areas. It is here
that memories are stored beyond the immediate (or short-term), and
here where these intermediate-term memories (ITM) are integrated back
into the neocortex to become long-term memory. We are still a long
way from understanding how these areas work.</P>

<P>DXM does seem to exert profound effects on temporal lobe limbic
networks. These networks may integrate sensory data from the
neocortex and the current contents of intermediate term memory,
keeping the results in a resonating feedback loop until it can be
discarded, acted upon (by passing it to the motor cortex), or
integrated permanently into long-term memory. Dissociatives seem to
lower the strength of sensory input, possibly by increasing the
firing of neurons which inhibit sensory networks. Similarly, the NMDA
receptors which are responsible for forming intermediate-term
memories are inhibited. So one is left with a resonant circuit whose
other inputs have been attenuated or cut off.</P>

<P>These patterns (internal states) pass repeatedly through the
limbic networks (and this seems to be strongly related to the
production of theta waves). Eventually, the "goal" (if one wants to
think of it that way) is probably to reach some sort of a decision,
and then pass the information to the motor cortex where action can be
taken; supporting this idea is the fact that theta wave activity
drops immediately before motor cortex activation. However, with motor
output reduced, one is left with a constant echoing of signals
through the limbic areas (possibly bouncing back and forth among the
neocortex, prefrontal lobes, and other areas). As these signals
bounce back and forth without being "tied down" to sensory input or
memory, they become increasingly distant in form from any normal
signals you're likely to encounter.</P>

<P>It has been suggested that all human temporal limbic networks
share a common "language", i.e., a particular pattern of neural
activity in one person's limbic system and an equivalent pattern in
another person's limbic system are paired with equivalent mental
states (<A HREF="refs.html#r331">331</A>). This is a bold assertion,
and if true means that internal states (such as happiness, anger,
boredom, familiarity, comfort, recognition, novelty, perhaps even as
complex as "I'm being abducted by aliens") may be encoded in
different individuals by the same neural patterns. Thus, the
particular patterns induced by dissociatives may simply correspond to
particular sensations, states, emotions, and/or beliefs, that people
interpret in similar ways.</P>

<P>Going one step further, it may be that the reason that people
encounter UFOs and aliens nowadays, whereas they encountered
airships, ghosts, faeries, spirits, etc., before, was that while the
internal states are the same, the memories or ideas associated with
them have changed. The neural network pattern that in a modern human
means "UFO" may have meant "demon" a few centuries ago. These
patterns are outside the range of normal brain functioning, but may
be induced by drugs, electromagnetic waves, temporal lobe seizures,
and so on.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.5.2 &nbsp; Complex Partial
Seizures</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
Partial seizures involve only a subset of the brain and, if they
occur in areas without direct connection to the motor cortex, may go
unnoticed. Complex partial seizures are those which involve a loss of
normal consciousness. Some have argued that there is a continuum
between normal and epileptic, and that most people have some sort of
simple or partial seizure activity at some point in their lives
(<A HREF="refs.html#r343">343</A>). Some signs of complex partial
epilepsy do seem to be more common among females who profess beliefs
in the paranormal (<A HREF="refs.html#r341">341</A>).</P>

<P>On the other hand, a significant lack of humor is one of the
hallmarks of people who suffer from temporal lobe complex partial
seizures and of the experiences induced by the seizures themselves.
Furthermore, those with complex partial epilepsy may show increased
fantasizing but often show reduced self-esteem (<A HREF="refs.html#r334">334</A>).
Obviously, many people with a perfectly normal or even well-developed
sense of humor are having paranormal experiences (both on and off
drugs).</P>

<P>Whether one calls it seizures or abnormal network activity, it
does seem to be responsible for some interesting things. Most common
are sensed presences (<A HREF="refs.html#r339">339</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r348">348</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r349">349</A>)
and vestibular sensations (<A HREF="refs.html#r332">332</A>). The
former may be an intrusion of the right hemisphere's self-concept
into the left hemisphere's consciousness (<A HREF="refs.html#r335">335</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r342">342</A>).
Persinger found that such sensed presences also occurred during times
of verbal creativity, and may explain the embodiment of creativity in
the form of the Muse (<A HREF="refs.html#r348">348</A>). In fact, a
more general view of the right hemispheric consciousness as an
"alien" or "godlike" presence has been suggested by Jaynes (<A HREF="refs.html#r350">350</A>).</P>

Environment</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
Another idea is that while these internal neural network states are
the reason for such curious experiences, it's not the DXM (or other
dissociative) alone that's responsible for the content of the
experience. Instead, the DXM is just priming the temporal lobe limbic
areas to receive information from "extrasensory" sources.</P>

<P>Before you shrug this off, however, let me explain what I mean by
extrasensory. Perhaps I should have used another term, as I am not
calling for one to accept psychic powers; I'm merely claiming that
the brain may be susceptible to the environment in ways which we
don't usually acknowledge.</P>

<P>The most likely of these is ultra-low frequency electromagnetic
and magnetic waves, which seem to be received quite well by the
hippocampus and surrounding areas (<A HREF="refs.html#r330">330</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r336">336-337</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r346">346-347</A>).
In fact, many species have a well-defined "inner compass" which reads
the magnetic field to help determine position, and in humans,
magnetite particles have been detected in the hippocampus (<A HREF="refs.html#r354">354</A>).
These may be an evolutionary leftover, like the appendix, or they may
still function, providing part of the overall feeling or
<I>zeitgeist</I> of a particular place. Humans are susceptible to
low-frequency magnetic stimulation of the temporal lobes, and do
respond to geomagnetic events (<A HREF="refs.html#r330">330</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r332">332-333</A>).
Alien sightings increase significantly before earthquakes, and some
have even suggested using these as a predictor of future geological
events. In addition to direct effects on the limbic areas,
geomagnetic activity also lowers the activity of melatonin; melatonin
has been shown to reduce the frequency of seizures (<A HREF="refs.html#r347">347</A>).</P>

<P>Another possibility is that information is being perceived by the
senses but forgotten, or never noticed, by the conscious mind. This
information could form a complex tapestry of ideas and concepts that
we are not directly aware of, and could manifest itself in
breakthroughs, insights, and so on.</P>

<P>There is a (somewhat suspect) theory called the "100th monkey
phenomenon", which posits that when enough members of a society learn
something, eventually everyone will become aware of it without
directly coming into contact with it. Unfortunately for its
adherents, the original research on monkeys acquiring skills turned
out to be flawed. However, it is worth noting that slang expressions,
ideas, and so on seem to arise in a culture from numerous sources at
once. What is probably going on is that the conditions that lead to
these expressions and ideas saturate society, and enough people are
wired similarly to come up with the same ideas.</P>

<P>This is what I mean by the "unseen environment" -- unconscious
factors, whether of sensory or unconscious origin, that can affect us
and seemingly come from nowhere. Perhaps many of the experiences
people have on dissociatives are a result of this unconscious data
coming to conscious mind. One possibility is that with the temporal
circuitry in a closed feedback loop, slowly varying geomagnetic waves
can induce common sequences of internal states in people. Another
possibility is that there are unrecognized influences of popular
literature (e.g., science fiction novels and movies) which color the
dissociative experience.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8.5.4 &nbsp; Spiritual
Explanations</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
If you want to go really far out on a limb, one can even come up with
a possible theory that involves real aliens or spirits. Suppose that
these creatures do exist, and that they exist in a primarily
noncorporeal form (or, perhaps, they are corporeal, but influence us
through noncorporeal mechanisms). Let's say for example, that there
are electromagnetic entities, made up of flux lines, charged
particles, and undoubtedly things we don't know about, that are alive
and sentient. These entities generally hang out in deep space, or in
the ionosphere, and can exert only a limited influence on the human
mind because sensory data normally drowns them out.</P>

<P>With the senses cut off by dissociatives, however, they can apply
enough energy to induce particular states in our minds. They do their
best to communicate with us, but can only do so through the roughest
of concepts, emotions, and ideas. Perhaps during geophysical events,
when a great deal of magnetic energy is available near the ground,
they can come down, feed off this energy, and contact people
directly. Maybe they can even "construct" objects out of ionized
particles and gases. Like ball lightning, these objects may very well
tend to be radially symmetric, appearing as spheres, eggs, donuts,
saucers, and the like.</P>

<P>Regardless of the situation enabling their contact, once they
establish contact with us, they try to communicate with us. However,
because of the limitations, we can only interpret their ideas in
terms we are familiar with: abductions, experiments, placing
microchips in our brains, or taking samples from our bodies. From
their point of view they may intend to convey something totally
different, but cannot bridge the language gap.</P>

<P>Finally, they leave, often leaving behind such physical remnants
as magentized materials, curious radially symmetric patterns on the
ground (indicative of a strong magnetic field and radial ion wind,
perhaps?), memory gaps (which tend to happen when the brain is
exposed to strong electromagnetic fields), and the like.</P>

<P>Of course, this is all so far off the deep end in speculation that
there's nothing whatsoever scientific about it. One could just as
easily say that these effects are the result of natural magnetic and
electric phenomena. Until someone manages to demonstrate that alien
encounters <I>require</I> magnetic stimuli of a more complex nature
than can be explained by simple natural events, this is no more
scientific than any religious faith.</P>

<P>One last point I'd like to bring up. In conversation with these
entities throughout history, the entities (from faeries to aliens)
typically report a strong aversion to iron. Now, iron has two
interesting properties. One, it is at the "bottom of the well" so to
speak in nuclear energy -- you can't gain energy by either fission or
fusion of the iron nucleus. Two, and perhaps more intruigingly, iron
is ferromagnetic, and traps magnetic flux lines. If I were an
electromagnetic entity, whose very form was made out of such flux
lines, I wouldn't appreciate someone dorking with them. Of course, a
more reasonable explanation is that this aversion to iron is a
remnant from the end of the Bronze Age, when iron was a magical
metal. But the flux line theory makes a much better story, don't you
think?</P>

Many of these effects seem to be maximized when theta waves are

the limbic system. Photic (light) and sound stimulation, using "light
and sound" machines (see <A HREF="dxm_most.html#toc.7.4.3">Section

<P><BR>
If you really want to go for the gusto, you can use direct magnetic
stimulation of the temporal lobes. Check out papers by Persinger
(there are numerous others in the field) for a start on the nature of
these devices. A lot of research is being done currently in
transcranial magnetic stimulation, so in addition to dorking with
your temporal lobes you can also try mapping your motor and sensory
cortex and checking out the potential antidepressant effect of left
prefrontal cortex magnetic stimulation. Actually, if you really are
interested in any of this, clear it with a physician first.</P>

A few people report that taking a low "attack" dose at lower second

Meditation is of course a wonderful tool for achieving altered
states, with or without the use of drugs. Various meditation
techniques exist, and I'm in no position to describe them, but based
on published reports I would say that Transcendental Mediation is
well documented as capable of inducing these altered states
(<A HREF="refs.html#r349">349</A>). Persinger suggested
hypothetically that Transcendental Meditation may induce temporal
lobe seizures via a mechanism he called "cognitive kindling"
(<A HREF="refs.html#r344">344</A>), but another paper disputed this,
and I haven't noticed meditators convulsing with any appreciable
frequency.</P>

Drugs are tools and like all tools they have their limits. Whenever
one uses a drug for its mental, psychological, or even spiritual
effects, one must remember that the tool itself can never replace
hard work and committment. Some would argue that using drugs for
spiritual or magickal purposes is completely misguided, but others
report great benefit from the use of various psychoactive drugs in
meditation, spiritual exploration, and development of a personal
philosophy.</P>

<P>Most people who are experienced with the use of drugs in this
context must never take the place of sober work. Drugs may be ideal
for showing one the possibilities of the mind, but once awakened to
these possibilities, it is perhaps best to let memory and familiarity
take the place of drug use. It is probably best to limit the use of
DXM to the minimum necessary to accomplish a given goal, and with
time it should become totally unnecessary. Remember, DXM can be a
step along the path, but it should never become the path itself.</P>

Epilepsy</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
Many of the methods discussed above are capable of aggravating an
existing temporal lobe epilepsy condition (and probably other forms).
Furthermore, people who suffer from complex partial seizures may be
more likely to experience paranormal events (<A HREF="refs.html#r334">334</A>,<A HREF="refs.html#r341">341</A>),
so if you're already talking fluently with the aliens, you may want
to be wary about giving yourself extra help. This type of epilepsy
can remain confined to the temporal lobes forever, or can generalize
to involve the cortex, and in extreme cases lead to seizures severe
enough to produce brain damage or even death.</P>
