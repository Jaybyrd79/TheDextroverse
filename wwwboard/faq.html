<P>Can I put html tags or images in my posts?</P>

<P>No. You can not use HTML tags in any field. The maintainer of the
script has disallowed any HTML. The script will just throw out
everything in &lt;&gt;'s.</P>

<P>Why didn't my post show up?</P>

<P>Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did
not reload the page, it simply pulled it out of cache. Please reload
your browser and it should then appear.</P>
